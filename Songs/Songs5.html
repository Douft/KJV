            <p class="verse" id="v-22-005-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.22.005.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>I sleep, but my heart waketh: it is the voice of my beloved that knocketh, saying, Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled: for my head is filled with dew, and my locks with the drops of the night.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-22-005-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.22.005.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>I have put off my coat; how shall I put it on? I have washed my feet; how shall I defile them?</p>
