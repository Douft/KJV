            <p class="verse" id="v-22-008-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.22.008.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>I would lead thee, and bring thee into my mother's house, who would instruct me: I would cause thee to drink of spiced wine of the juice of my pomegranate.</p>

I raised thee up under the apple tree: there thy mother brought thee forth: there she brought thee forth that bare thee.</p>
