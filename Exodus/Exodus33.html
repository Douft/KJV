            <p class="verse" id="v-02-033-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.02.033.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>And I will send an angel before thee; and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-02-033-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.02.033.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>Unto a land flowing with milk and honey: for I will not go up in the midst of thee; for thou art a stiffnecked people: lest I consume thee in the way.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-02-033-004" data-verse-ref="KJV.02.033.004"><span class="verse-number">4</span>And when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned: and no man did put on him his ornaments.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-02-033-005" data-verse-ref="KJV.02.033.005"><span class="verse-number">5</span>For the LORD had said unto Moses, Say unto the children of Israel, Ye are a stiffnecked people: I will come up into the midst of thee in a moment, and consume thee: therefore now put off thy ornaments from thee, that I may know what to do unto thee.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-02-033-006" data-verse-ref="KJV.02.033.006"><span class="verse-number">6</span>And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments by the mount Horeb.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-02-033-007" data-verse-ref="KJV.02.033.007"><span class="verse-number">7</span>And Moses took the tabernacle, and pitched it without the camp, afar off from the camp, and called it the Tabernacle of the congregation. And it came to pass, that every one which sought the LORD went out unto the tabernacle of the congregation, which was without the camp.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-02-033-008" data-verse-ref="KJV.02.033.008"><span class="verse-number">8</span>And it came to pass, when Moses went out unto the tabernacle, that all the people rose up, and stood every man at his tent door, and looked after Moses, until he was gone into the tabernacle.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-02-033-009" data-verse-ref="KJV.02.033.009"><span class="verse-number">9</span>And it came to pass, as Moses entered into the tabernacle, the cloudy pillar descended, and stood at the door of the tabernacle, and the LORD talked with Moses.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-02-033-010" data-verse-ref="KJV.02.033.010"><span class="verse-number">10</span>And all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand at the tabernacle door: and all the people rose up and worshipped, every man in his tent door.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-02-033-011" data-verse-ref="KJV.02.033.011"><span class="verse-number">11</span>And the LORD spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh unto his friend. And he turned again into the camp: but his servant Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, departed not out of the tabernacle.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-02-033-016" data-verse-ref="KJV.02.033.016"><span class="verse-number">16</span>For wherein shall it be known here that I and thy people have found grace in thy sight? is it not in that thou goest with us? so shall we be separated, I and thy people, from all the people that are upon the face of the earth.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-02-033-017" data-verse-ref="KJV.02.033.017"><span class="verse-number">17</span>And the LORD said unto Moses, I will do this thing also that thou hast spoken: for thou hast found grace in my sight, and I know thee by name.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-02-033-018" data-verse-ref="KJV.02.033.018"><span class="verse-number">18</span>And he said, I beseech thee, shew me thy glory.</p>
