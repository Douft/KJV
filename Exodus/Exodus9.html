            <p class="verse" id="v-02-009-034" data-verse-ref="KJV.02.009.034"><span class="verse-number">34</span>And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders were ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened his heart, he and his servants.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-02-009-035" data-verse-ref="KJV.02.009.035"><span class="verse-number">35</span>And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, neither would he let the children of Israel go; as the LORD had spoken by Moses.</p>
