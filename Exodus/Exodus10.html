            <p class="verse" id="v-02-010-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.02.010.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>And that thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son, and of thy son's son, what things I have wrought in Egypt, and my signs which I have done among them; that ye may know how that I am the LORD.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-02-010-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.02.010.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>And Moses and Aaron came in unto Pharaoh, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, How long wilt thou refuse to humble thyself before me? let my people go, that they may serve me.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-02-010-006" data-verse-ref="KJV.02.010.006"><span class="verse-number">6</span>And they shall fill thy houses, and the houses of all thy servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians; which neither thy fathers, nor thy fathers' fathers have seen, since the day that they were upon the earth unto this day. And he turned himself, and went out from Pharaoh.</p>
