            <p class="verse" id="v-02-018-008" data-verse-ref="KJV.02.018.008"><span class="verse-number">8</span>And Moses told his father in law all that the LORD had done unto Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel's sake, and all the travail that had come upon them by the way, and how the LORD delivered them.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-02-018-021" data-verse-ref="KJV.02.018.021"><span class="verse-number">21</span>Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place such over them, to be rulers of thousands, and rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-02-018-022" data-verse-ref="KJV.02.018.022"><span class="verse-number">22</span>And let them judge the people at all seasons: and it shall be, that every great matter they shall bring unto thee, but every small matter they shall judge: so shall it be easier for thyself, and they shall bear the burden with thee.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-02-018-023" data-verse-ref="KJV.02.018.023"><span class="verse-number">23</span>If thou shalt do this thing, and God command thee so, then thou shalt be able to endure, and all this people shall also go to their place in peace.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-02-018-024" data-verse-ref="KJV.02.018.024"><span class="verse-number">24</span>So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father in law, and did all that he had said.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-02-018-025" data-verse-ref="KJV.02.018.025"><span class="verse-number">25</span>And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-02-018-026" data-verse-ref="KJV.02.018.026"><span class="verse-number">26</span>And they judged the people at all seasons: the hard causes they brought unto Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-02-018-027" data-verse-ref="KJV.02.018.027"><span class="verse-number">27</span>And Moses let his father in law depart; and he went his way into his own land.</p>
