            <p class="verse" id="v-02-017-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.02.017.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>Wherefore the people did chide with Moses, and said, Give us water that we may drink. And Moses said unto them, Why chide ye with me? wherefore do ye tempt the LORD?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-02-017-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.02.017.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>And the people thirsted there for water; and the people murmured against Moses, and said, Wherefore is this that thou hast brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-02-017-004" data-verse-ref="KJV.02.017.004"><span class="verse-number">4</span>And Moses cried unto the LORD, saying, What shall I do unto this people? they be almost ready to stone me.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-02-017-005" data-verse-ref="KJV.02.017.005"><span class="verse-number">5</span>And the LORD said unto Moses, Go on before the people, and take with thee of the elders of Israel; and thy rod, wherewith thou smotest the river, take in thine hand, and go.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-02-017-006" data-verse-ref="KJV.02.017.006"><span class="verse-number">6</span>Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb; and thou shalt smite the rock, and there shall come water out of it, that the people may drink.

            <p class="verse" id="v-02-017-008" data-verse-ref="KJV.02.017.008"><span class="verse-number">8</span>Then came Amalek, and fought with Israel in Rephidim.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-02-017-010" data-verse-ref="KJV.02.017.010"><span class="verse-number">10</span>So Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with Amalek: and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-02-017-011" data-verse-ref="KJV.02.017.011"><span class="verse-number">11</span>And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed: and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-02-017-012" data-verse-ref="KJV.02.017.012"><span class="verse-number">12</span>But Moses' hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it under him, and he sat thereon; and Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side; and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-02-017-013" data-verse-ref="KJV.02.017.013"><span class="verse-number">13</span>And Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-02-017-015" data-verse-ref="KJV.02.017.015"><span class="verse-number">15</span>And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it Jehovahnissi:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-02-017-016" data-verse-ref="KJV.02.017.016"><span class="verse-number">16</span>For he said, Because the LORD hath sworn that the LORD will have war with Amalek from generation to generation.</p>
