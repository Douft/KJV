            <p class="verse" id="v-39-003-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.39.003.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>But who may abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand when he appeareth? for he is like a refiner's fire, and like fullers' soap:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-39-003-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.39.003.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>And he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver: and he shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that they may offer unto the LORD an offering in righteousness.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-39-003-004" data-verse-ref="KJV.39.003.004"><span class="verse-number">4</span>Then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto the LORD, as in the days of old, and as in former years.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-39-003-005" data-verse-ref="KJV.39.003.005"><span class="verse-number">5</span>And I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against false swearers, and against those that oppress the hireling in his wages, the widow, and the fatherless, and that turn aside the stranger from his right, and fear not me, saith the LORD of hosts.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-39-003-006" data-verse-ref="KJV.39.003.006"><span class="verse-number">6</span>For I am the LORD, I change not; therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed.</p>
