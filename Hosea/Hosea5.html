            <p class="verse" id="v-28-005-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.28.005.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>And the revolters are profound to make slaughter, though I have been a rebuker of them all.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-28-005-004" data-verse-ref="KJV.28.005.004"><span class="verse-number">4</span>They will not frame their doings to turn unto their God: for the spirit of whoredoms is in the midst of them, and they have not known the LORD.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-28-005-005" data-verse-ref="KJV.28.005.005"><span class="verse-number">5</span>And the pride of Israel doth testify to his face: therefore shall Israel and Ephraim fall in their iniquity; Judah also shall fall with them.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-28-005-006" data-verse-ref="KJV.28.005.006"><span class="verse-number">6</span>They shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek the LORD; but they shall not find him; he hath withdrawn himself from them.</p>
