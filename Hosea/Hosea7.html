            <p class="verse" id="v-28-007-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.28.007.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>And they consider not in their hearts that I remember all their wickedness: now their own doings have beset them about; they are before my face.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-28-007-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.28.007.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>They make the king glad with their wickedness, and the princes with their lies.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-28-007-004" data-verse-ref="KJV.28.007.004"><span class="verse-number">4</span>They are all adulterers, as an oven heated by the baker, who ceaseth from raising after he hath kneaded the dough, until it be leavened.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-28-007-005" data-verse-ref="KJV.28.007.005"><span class="verse-number">5</span>In the day of our king the princes have made him sick with bottles of wine; he stretched out his hand with scorners.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-28-007-006" data-verse-ref="KJV.28.007.006"><span class="verse-number">6</span>For they have made ready their heart like an oven, whiles they lie in wait: their baker sleepeth all the night; in the morning it burneth as a flaming fire.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-28-007-007" data-verse-ref="KJV.28.007.007"><span class="verse-number">7</span>They are all hot as an oven, and have devoured their judges; all their kings are fallen: there is none among them that calleth unto me.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-28-007-008" data-verse-ref="KJV.28.007.008"><span class="verse-number">8</span>Ephraim, he hath mixed himself among the people; Ephraim is a cake not turned.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-28-007-010" data-verse-ref="KJV.28.007.010"><span class="verse-number">10</span>And the pride of Israel testifieth to his face: and they do not return to the LORD their God, nor seek him for all this.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-28-007-014" data-verse-ref="KJV.28.007.014"><span class="verse-number">14</span>And they have not cried unto me with their heart, when they howled upon their beds: they assemble themselves for corn and wine, and they rebel against me.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-28-007-015" data-verse-ref="KJV.28.007.015"><span class="verse-number">15</span>Though I have bound and strengthened their arms, yet do they imagine mischief against me.</p>
