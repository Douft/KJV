            <p class="verse" id="v-28-002-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.28.002.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>Lest I strip her naked, and set her as in the day that she was born, and make her as a wilderness, and set her like a dry land, and slay her with thirst.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-28-002-006" data-verse-ref="KJV.28.002.006"><span class="verse-number">6</span>Therefore, behold, I will hedge up thy way with thorns, and make a wall, that she shall not find her paths.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-28-002-008" data-verse-ref="KJV.28.002.008"><span class="verse-number">8</span>For she did not know that I gave her corn, and wine, and oil, and multiplied her silver and gold, which they prepared for Baal.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-28-002-016" data-verse-ref="KJV.28.002.016"><span class="verse-number">16</span>And it shall be at that day, saith the LORD, that thou shalt call me Ishi; and shalt call me no more Baali.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-28-002-017" data-verse-ref="KJV.28.002.017"><span class="verse-number">17</span>For I will take away the names of Baalim out of her mouth, and they shall no more be remembered by their name.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-28-002-019" data-verse-ref="KJV.28.002.019"><span class="verse-number">19</span>And I will betroth thee unto me for ever; yea, I will betroth thee unto me in righteousness, and in judgment, and in lovingkindness, and in mercies.</p>
