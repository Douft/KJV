            <p class="verse" id="v-28-010-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.28.010.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>Their heart is divided; now shall they be found faulty: he shall break down their altars, he shall spoil their images.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-28-010-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.28.010.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>For now they shall say, We have no king, because we feared not the LORD; what then should a king do to us?</p>
