And he said, Ye shall not send.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-12-002-017" data-verse-ref="KJV.12.002.017"><span class="verse-number">17</span>And when they urged him till he was ashamed, he said, Send. They sent therefore fifty men; and they sought three days, but found him not.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-12-002-018" data-verse-ref="KJV.12.002.018"><span class="verse-number">18</span>And when they came again to him, (for he tarried at Jericho,) he said unto them, Did I not say unto you, Go not?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-12-002-019" data-verse-ref="KJV.12.002.019"><span class="verse-number">19</span>And the men of the city said unto Elisha, Behold, I pray thee, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord seeth: but the water is naught, and the ground barren.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-12-002-020" data-verse-ref="KJV.12.002.020"><span class="verse-number">20</span>And he said, Bring me a new cruse, and put salt therein. And they brought it to him.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-12-002-021" data-verse-ref="KJV.12.002.021"><span class="verse-number">21</span>And he went forth unto the spring of the waters, and cast the salt in there, and said, Thus saith the LORD, I have healed these waters; there shall not be from thence any more death or barren land.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-12-002-022" data-verse-ref="KJV.12.002.022"><span class="verse-number">22</span>So the waters were healed unto this day, according to the saying of Elisha which he spake.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-12-002-023" data-verse-ref="KJV.12.002.023"><span class="verse-number">23</span>And he went up from thence unto Bethel: and as he was going up by the way, there came forth little children out of the city, and mocked him, and said unto him, Go up, thou bald head; go up, thou bald head.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-12-002-024" data-verse-ref="KJV.12.002.024"><span class="verse-number">24</span>And he turned back, and looked on them, and cursed them in the name of the LORD. And there came forth two she bears out of the wood, and tare forty and two children of them.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-12-002-025" data-verse-ref="KJV.12.002.025"><span class="verse-number">25</span>And he went from thence to mount Carmel, and from thence he returned to Samaria.</p>
