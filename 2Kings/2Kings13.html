            <p class="verse" id="v-12-013-008" data-verse-ref="KJV.12.013.008"><span class="verse-number">8</span>Now the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz, and all that he did, and his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-12-013-015" data-verse-ref="KJV.12.013.015"><span class="verse-number">15</span>And Elisha said unto him, Take bow and arrows. And he took unto him bow and arrows.</p>

And he shot. And he said, The arrow of the LORD'S deliverance, and the arrow of deliverance from Syria: for thou shalt smite the Syrians in Aphek, till thou have consumed them.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-12-013-018" data-verse-ref="KJV.12.013.018"><span class="verse-number">18</span>And he said, Take the arrows. And he took them. And he said unto the king of Israel, Smite upon the ground. And he smote thrice, and stayed.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-12-013-019" data-verse-ref="KJV.12.013.019"><span class="verse-number">19</span>And the man of God was wroth with him, and said, Thou shouldest have smitten five or six times; then hadst thou smitten Syria till thou hadst consumed it: whereas now thou shalt smite Syria but thrice.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-12-013-020" data-verse-ref="KJV.12.013.020"><span class="verse-number">20</span>And Elisha died, and they buried him. And the bands of the Moabites invaded the land at the coming in of the year.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-12-013-021" data-verse-ref="KJV.12.013.021"><span class="verse-number">21</span>And it came to pass, as they were burying a man, that, behold, they spied a band of men; and they cast the man into the sepulchre of Elisha: and when the man was let down, and touched the bones of Elisha, he revived, and stood up on his feet.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-12-013-022" data-verse-ref="KJV.12.013.022"><span class="verse-number">22</span>But Hazael king of Syria oppressed Israel all the days of Jehoahaz.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-12-013-023" data-verse-ref="KJV.12.013.023"><span class="verse-number">23</span>And the LORD was gracious unto them, and had compassion on them, and had respect unto them, because of his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and would not destroy them, neither cast he them from his presence as yet.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-12-013-024" data-verse-ref="KJV.12.013.024"><span class="verse-number">24</span>So Hazael king of Syria died; and Benhadad his son reigned in his stead.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-12-013-025" data-verse-ref="KJV.12.013.025"><span class="verse-number">25</span>And Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz took again out of the hand of Benhadad the son of Hazael the cities, which he had taken out of the hand of Jehoahaz his father by war. Three times did Joash beat him, and recovered the cities of Israel.</p>
