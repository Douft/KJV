            <p class="verse" id="v-66-002-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.66.002.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>I know thy works, and thy labour, and thy patience, and how thou canst not bear them which are evil: and thou hast tried them which say they are apostles, and are not, and hast found them liars:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-66-002-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.66.002.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>And hast borne, and hast patience, and for my name's sake hast laboured, and hast not fainted.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-66-002-004" data-verse-ref="KJV.66.002.004"><span class="verse-number">4</span>Nevertheless I have somewhat against thee, because thou hast left thy first love.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-66-002-005" data-verse-ref="KJV.66.002.005"><span class="verse-number">5</span>Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou repent.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-66-002-006" data-verse-ref="KJV.66.002.006"><span class="verse-number">6</span>But this thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-66-002-007" data-verse-ref="KJV.66.002.007"><span class="verse-number">7</span>He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-66-002-008" data-verse-ref="KJV.66.002.008"><span class="verse-number">8</span>And unto the angel of the church in Smyrna write; These things saith the first and the last, which was dead, and is alive;</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-66-002-009" data-verse-ref="KJV.66.002.009"><span class="verse-number">9</span>I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou art rich) and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-66-002-010" data-verse-ref="KJV.66.002.010"><span class="verse-number">10</span>Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer: behold, the devil shall cast some of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye shall have tribulation ten days: be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-66-002-011" data-verse-ref="KJV.66.002.011"><span class="verse-number">11</span>He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-66-002-012" data-verse-ref="KJV.66.002.012"><span class="verse-number">12</span>And to the angel of the church in Pergamos write; These things saith he which hath the sharp sword with two edges;</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-66-002-013" data-verse-ref="KJV.66.002.013"><span class="verse-number">13</span>I know thy works, and where thou dwellest, even where Satan's seat is: and thou holdest fast my name, and hast not denied my faith, even in those days wherein Antipas was my faithful martyr, who was slain among you, where Satan dwelleth.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-66-002-014" data-verse-ref="KJV.66.002.014"><span class="verse-number">14</span>But I have a few things against thee, because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balac to cast a stumblingblock before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed unto idols, and to commit fornication.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-66-002-015" data-verse-ref="KJV.66.002.015"><span class="verse-number">15</span>So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, which thing I hate.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-66-002-016" data-verse-ref="KJV.66.002.016"><span class="verse-number">16</span>Repent; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-66-002-018" data-verse-ref="KJV.66.002.018"><span class="verse-number">18</span>And unto the angel of the church in Thyatira write; These things saith the Son of God, who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire, and his feet are like fine brass;</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-66-002-019" data-verse-ref="KJV.66.002.019"><span class="verse-number">19</span>I know thy works, and charity, and service, and faith, and thy patience, and thy works; and the last to be more than the first.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-66-002-020" data-verse-ref="KJV.66.002.020"><span class="verse-number">20</span>Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee, because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel, which calleth herself a prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed unto idols.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-66-002-021" data-verse-ref="KJV.66.002.021"><span class="verse-number">21</span>And I gave her space to repent of her fornication; and she repented not.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-66-002-022" data-verse-ref="KJV.66.002.022"><span class="verse-number">22</span>Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation, except they repent of their deeds.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-66-002-023" data-verse-ref="KJV.66.002.023"><span class="verse-number">23</span>And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches shall know that I am he which searcheth the reins and hearts: and I will give unto every one of you according to your works.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-66-002-024" data-verse-ref="KJV.66.002.024"><span class="verse-number">24</span>But unto you I say, and unto the rest in Thyatira, as many as have not this doctrine, and which have not known the depths of Satan, as they speak; I will put upon you none other burden.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-66-002-025" data-verse-ref="KJV.66.002.025"><span class="verse-number">25</span>But that which ye have already hold fast till I come.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-66-002-026" data-verse-ref="KJV.66.002.026"><span class="verse-number">26</span>And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the nations:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-66-002-027" data-verse-ref="KJV.66.002.027"><span class="verse-number">27</span>And he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers: even as I received of my Father.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-66-002-028" data-verse-ref="KJV.66.002.028"><span class="verse-number">28</span>And I will give him the morning star.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-66-002-029" data-verse-ref="KJV.66.002.029"><span class="verse-number">29</span>He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.</p>
