            <p class="verse" id="v-66-020-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.66.020.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years,</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-66-020-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.66.020.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>And cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years should be fulfilled: and after that he must be loosed a little season.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-66-020-004" data-verse-ref="KJV.66.020.004"><span class="verse-number">4</span>And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-66-020-005" data-verse-ref="KJV.66.020.005"><span class="verse-number">5</span>But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished. This is the first resurrection.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-66-020-008" data-verse-ref="KJV.66.020.008"><span class="verse-number">8</span>And shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to battle: the number of whom is as the sand of the sea.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-66-020-013" data-verse-ref="KJV.66.020.013"><span class="verse-number">13</span>And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works.</p>
