            <p class="verse" id="v-66-009-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.66.009.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>And he opened the bottomless pit; and there arose a smoke out of the pit, as the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-66-009-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.66.009.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>And there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth: and unto them was given power, as the scorpions of the earth have power.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-66-009-018" data-verse-ref="KJV.66.009.018"><span class="verse-number">18</span>By these three was the third part of men killed, by the fire, and by the smoke, and by the brimstone, which issued out of their mouths.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-66-009-020" data-verse-ref="KJV.66.009.020"><span class="verse-number">20</span>And the rest of the men which were not killed by these plagues yet repented not of the works of their hands, that they should not worship devils, and idols of gold, and silver, and brass, and stone, and of wood: which neither can see, nor hear, nor walk:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-66-009-021" data-verse-ref="KJV.66.009.021"><span class="verse-number">21</span>Neither repented they of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of their fornication, nor of their thefts.</p>
