As I live, saith the Lord GOD, I will not be inquired of by you.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-26-020-005" data-verse-ref="KJV.26.020.005"><span class="verse-number">5</span>And say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the day when I chose Israel, and lifted up mine hand unto the seed of the house of Jacob, and made myself known unto them in the land of Egypt, when I lifted up mine hand unto them, saying, I am the LORD your God;</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-26-020-006" data-verse-ref="KJV.26.020.006"><span class="verse-number">6</span>In the day that I lifted up mine hand unto them, to bring them forth of the land of Egypt into a land that I had espied for them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-26-020-007" data-verse-ref="KJV.26.020.007"><span class="verse-number">7</span>Then said I unto them, Cast ye away every man the abominations of his eyes, and defile not yourselves with the idols of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-26-020-022" data-verse-ref="KJV.26.020.022"><span class="verse-number">22</span>Nevertheless I withdrew mine hand, and wrought for my name's sake, that it should not be polluted in the sight of the heathen, in whose sight I brought them forth.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-26-020-023" data-verse-ref="KJV.26.020.023"><span class="verse-number">23</span>I lifted up mine hand unto them also in the wilderness, that I would scatter them among the heathen, and disperse them through the countries;</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-26-020-024" data-verse-ref="KJV.26.020.024"><span class="verse-number">24</span>Because they had not executed my judgments, but had despised my statutes, and had polluted my sabbaths, and their eyes were after their fathers' idols.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-26-020-027" data-verse-ref="KJV.26.020.027"><span class="verse-number">27</span>Therefore, son of man, speak unto the house of Israel, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Yet in this your fathers have blasphemed me, in that they have committed a trespass against me.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-26-020-028" data-verse-ref="KJV.26.020.028"><span class="verse-number">28</span>For when I had brought them into the land, for the which I lifted up mine hand to give it to them, then they saw every high hill, and all the thick trees, and they offered there their sacrifices, and there they presented the provocation of their offering: there also they made their sweet savour, and poured out there their drink offerings.</p>
