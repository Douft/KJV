            <p class="verse" id="v-26-033-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.26.033.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>Son of man, speak to the children of thy people, and say unto them, When I bring the sword upon a land, if the people of the land take a man of their coasts, and set him for their watchman:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-26-033-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.26.033.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>If when he seeth the sword come upon the land, he blow the trumpet, and warn the people;</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-26-033-005" data-verse-ref="KJV.26.033.005"><span class="verse-number">5</span>He heard the sound of the trumpet, and took not warning; his blood shall be upon him. But he that taketh warning shall deliver his soul.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-26-033-006" data-verse-ref="KJV.26.033.006"><span class="verse-number">6</span>But if the watchman see the sword come, and blow not the trumpet, and the people be not warned; if the sword come, and take any person from among them, he is taken away in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at the watchman's hand.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-26-033-007" data-verse-ref="KJV.26.033.007"><span class="verse-number">7</span>So thou, O son of man, I have set thee a watchman unto the house of Israel; therefore thou shalt hear the word at my mouth, and warn them from me.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-26-033-008" data-verse-ref="KJV.26.033.008"><span class="verse-number">8</span>When I say unto the wicked, O wicked man, thou shalt surely die; if thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-26-033-021" data-verse-ref="KJV.26.033.021"><span class="verse-number">21</span>And it came to pass in the twelfth year of our captivity, in the tenth month, in the fifth day of the month, that one that had escaped out of Jerusalem came unto me, saying, The city is smitten.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-26-033-022" data-verse-ref="KJV.26.033.022"><span class="verse-number">22</span>Now the hand of the LORD was upon me in the evening, afore he that was escaped came; and had opened my mouth, until he came to me in the morning; and my mouth was opened, and I was no more dumb.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-26-033-023" data-verse-ref="KJV.26.033.023"><span class="verse-number">23</span>Then the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-26-033-024" data-verse-ref="KJV.26.033.024"><span class="verse-number">24</span>Son of man, they that inhabit those wastes of the land of Israel speak, saying, Abraham was one, and he inherited the land: but we are many; the land is given us for inheritance.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-26-033-025" data-verse-ref="KJV.26.033.025"><span class="verse-number">25</span>Wherefore say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Ye eat with the blood, and lift up your eyes toward your idols, and shed blood: and shall ye possess the land?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-26-033-026" data-verse-ref="KJV.26.033.026"><span class="verse-number">26</span>Ye stand upon your sword, ye work abomination, and ye defile every one his neighbour's wife: and shall ye possess the land?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-26-033-027" data-verse-ref="KJV.26.033.027"><span class="verse-number">27</span>Say thou thus unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; As I live, surely they that are in the wastes shall fall by the sword, and him that is in the open field will I give to the beasts to be devoured, and they that be in the forts and in the caves shall die of the pestilence.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-26-033-028" data-verse-ref="KJV.26.033.028"><span class="verse-number">28</span>For I will lay the land most desolate, and the pomp of her strength shall cease; and the mountains of Israel shall be desolate, that none shall pass through.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-26-033-030" data-verse-ref="KJV.26.033.030"><span class="verse-number">30</span>Also, thou son of man, the children of thy people still are talking against thee by the walls and in the doors of the houses, and speak one to another, every one to his brother, saying, Come, I pray you, and hear what is the word that cometh forth from the LORD.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-26-033-031" data-verse-ref="KJV.26.033.031"><span class="verse-number">31</span>And they come unto thee as the people cometh, and they sit before thee as my people, and they hear thy words, but they will not do them: for with their mouth they shew much love, but their heart goeth after their covetousness.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-26-033-032" data-verse-ref="KJV.26.033.032"><span class="verse-number">32</span>And, lo, thou art unto them as a very lovely song of one that hath a pleasant voice, and can play well on an instrument: for they hear thy words, but they do them not.</p>
