            <p class="verse" id="v-26-013-022" data-verse-ref="KJV.26.013.022"><span class="verse-number">22</span>Because with lies ye have made the heart of the righteous sad, whom I have not made sad; and strengthened the hands of the wicked, that he should not return from his wicked way, by promising him life:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-26-013-023" data-verse-ref="KJV.26.013.023"><span class="verse-number">23</span>Therefore ye shall see no more vanity, nor divine divinations: for I will deliver my people out of your hand: and ye shall know that I am the LORD.</p>
