            <p class="verse" id="v-26-021-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.26.021.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>And say to the land of Israel, Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I am against thee, and will draw forth my sword out of his sheath, and will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-26-021-004" data-verse-ref="KJV.26.021.004"><span class="verse-number">4</span>Seeing then that I will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked, therefore shall my sword go forth out of his sheath against all flesh from the south to the north:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-26-021-005" data-verse-ref="KJV.26.021.005"><span class="verse-number">5</span>That all flesh may know that I the LORD have drawn forth my sword out of his sheath: it shall not return any more.</p>
