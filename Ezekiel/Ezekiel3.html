            <p class="verse" id="v-26-003-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.26.003.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat that roll.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-26-003-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.26.003.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>And he said unto me, Son of man, cause thy belly to eat, and fill thy bowels with this roll that I give thee. Then did I eat it; and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-26-003-004" data-verse-ref="KJV.26.003.004"><span class="verse-number">4</span>And he said unto me, Son of man, go, get thee unto the house of Israel, and speak with my words unto them.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-26-003-005" data-verse-ref="KJV.26.003.005"><span class="verse-number">5</span>For thou art not sent to a people of a strange speech and of an hard language, but to the house of Israel;</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-26-003-006" data-verse-ref="KJV.26.003.006"><span class="verse-number">6</span>Not to many people of a strange speech and of an hard language, whose words thou canst not understand. Surely, had I sent thee to them, they would have hearkened unto thee.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-26-003-007" data-verse-ref="KJV.26.003.007"><span class="verse-number">7</span>But the house of Israel will not hearken unto thee; for they will not hearken unto me: for all the house of Israel are impudent and hardhearted.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-26-003-008" data-verse-ref="KJV.26.003.008"><span class="verse-number">8</span>Behold, I have made thy face strong against their faces, and thy forehead strong against their foreheads.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-26-003-009" data-verse-ref="KJV.26.003.009"><span class="verse-number">9</span>As an adamant harder than flint have I made thy forehead: fear them not, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they be a rebellious house.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-26-003-010" data-verse-ref="KJV.26.003.010"><span class="verse-number">10</span>Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, all my words that I shall speak unto thee receive in thine heart, and hear with thine ears.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-26-003-011" data-verse-ref="KJV.26.003.011"><span class="verse-number">11</span>And go, get thee to them of the captivity, unto the children of thy people, and speak unto them, and tell them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-26-003-012" data-verse-ref="KJV.26.003.012"><span class="verse-number">12</span>Then the spirit took me up, and I heard behind me a voice of a great rushing, saying, Blessed be the glory of the LORD from his place.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-26-003-013" data-verse-ref="KJV.26.003.013"><span class="verse-number">13</span>I heard also the noise of the wings of the living creatures that touched one another, and the noise of the wheels over against them, and a noise of a great rushing.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-26-003-014" data-verse-ref="KJV.26.003.014"><span class="verse-number">14</span>So the spirit lifted me up, and took me away, and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; but the hand of the LORD was strong upon me.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-26-003-015" data-verse-ref="KJV.26.003.015"><span class="verse-number">15</span>Then I came to them of the captivity at Telabib, that dwelt by the river of Chebar, and I sat where they sat, and remained there astonished among them seven days.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-26-003-016" data-verse-ref="KJV.26.003.016"><span class="verse-number">16</span>And it came to pass at the end of seven days, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-26-003-017" data-verse-ref="KJV.26.003.017"><span class="verse-number">17</span>Son of man, I have made thee a watchman unto the house of Israel: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-26-003-018" data-verse-ref="KJV.26.003.018"><span class="verse-number">18</span>When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and thou givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-26-003-019" data-verse-ref="KJV.26.003.019"><span class="verse-number">19</span>Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-26-003-020" data-verse-ref="KJV.26.003.020"><span class="verse-number">20</span>Again, When a righteous man doth turn from his righteousness, and commit iniquity, and I lay a stumblingblock before him, he shall die: because thou hast not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteousness which he hath done shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require at thine hand.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-26-003-021" data-verse-ref="KJV.26.003.021"><span class="verse-number">21</span>Nevertheless if thou warn the righteous man, that the righteous sin not, and he doth not sin, he shall surely live, because he is warned; also thou hast delivered thy soul.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-26-003-022" data-verse-ref="KJV.26.003.022"><span class="verse-number">22</span>And the hand of the LORD was there upon me; and he said unto me, Arise, go forth into the plain, and I will there talk with thee.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-26-003-023" data-verse-ref="KJV.26.003.023"><span class="verse-number">23</span>Then I arose, and went forth into the plain: and, behold, the glory of the LORD stood there, as the glory which I saw by the river of Chebar: and I fell on my face.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-26-003-024" data-verse-ref="KJV.26.003.024"><span class="verse-number">24</span>Then the spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet, and spake with me, and said unto me, Go, shut thyself within thine house.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-26-003-025" data-verse-ref="KJV.26.003.025"><span class="verse-number">25</span>But thou, O son of man, behold, they shall put bands upon thee, and shall bind thee with them, and thou shalt not go out among them:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-26-003-026" data-verse-ref="KJV.26.003.026"><span class="verse-number">26</span>And I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth, that thou shalt be dumb, and shalt not be to them a reprover: for they are a rebellious house.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-26-003-027" data-verse-ref="KJV.26.003.027"><span class="verse-number">27</span>But when I speak with thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; He that heareth, let him hear; and he that forbeareth, let him forbear: for they are a rebellious house.</p>
