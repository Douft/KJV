            <p class="verse" id="v-26-037-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.26.037.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>And caused me to pass by them round about: and, behold, there were very many in the open valley; and, lo, they were very dry.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-26-037-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.26.037.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>And he said unto me, Son of man, can these bones live? And I answered, O Lord GOD, thou knowest.</p>
