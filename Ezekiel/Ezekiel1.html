            <p class="verse" id="v-26-001-019" data-verse-ref="KJV.26.001.019"><span class="verse-number">19</span>And when the living creatures went, the wheels went by them: and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-26-001-020" data-verse-ref="KJV.26.001.020"><span class="verse-number">20</span>Whithersoever the spirit was to go, they went, thither was their spirit to go; and the wheels were lifted up over against them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-26-001-021" data-verse-ref="KJV.26.001.021"><span class="verse-number">21</span>When those went, these went; and when those stood, these stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up over against them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-26-001-022" data-verse-ref="KJV.26.001.022"><span class="verse-number">22</span>And the likeness of the firmament upon the heads of the living creature was as the colour of the terrible crystal, stretched forth over their heads above.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-26-001-023" data-verse-ref="KJV.26.001.023"><span class="verse-number">23</span>And under the firmament were their wings straight, the one toward the other: every one had two, which covered on this side, and every one had two, which covered on that side, their bodies.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-26-001-024" data-verse-ref="KJV.26.001.024"><span class="verse-number">24</span>And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings, like the noise of great waters, as the voice of the Almighty, the voice of speech, as the noise of an host: when they stood, they let down their wings.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-26-001-025" data-verse-ref="KJV.26.001.025"><span class="verse-number">25</span>And there was a voice from the firmament that was over their heads, when they stood, and had let down their wings.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-26-001-026" data-verse-ref="KJV.26.001.026"><span class="verse-number">26</span>And above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone: and upon the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-26-001-027" data-verse-ref="KJV.26.001.027"><span class="verse-number">27</span>And I saw as the colour of amber, as the appearance of fire round about within it, from the appearance of his loins even upward, and from the appearance of his loins even downward, I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and it had brightness round about.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-26-001-028" data-verse-ref="KJV.26.001.028"><span class="verse-number">28</span>As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD. And when I saw it, I fell upon my face, and I heard a voice of one that spake.</p>
