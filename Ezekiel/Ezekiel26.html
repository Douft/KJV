            <p class="verse" id="v-26-026-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.26.026.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>Son of man, because that Tyrus hath said against Jerusalem, Aha, she is broken that was the gates of the people: she is turned unto me: I shall be replenished, now she is laid waste:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-26-026-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.26.026.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against thee, O Tyrus, and will cause many nations to come up against thee, as the sea causeth his waves to come up.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-26-026-004" data-verse-ref="KJV.26.026.004"><span class="verse-number">4</span>And they shall destroy the walls of Tyrus, and break down her towers: I will also scrape her dust from her, and make her like the top of a rock.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-26-026-005" data-verse-ref="KJV.26.026.005"><span class="verse-number">5</span>It shall be a place for the spreading of nets in the midst of the sea: for I have spoken it, saith the Lord GOD: and it shall become a spoil to the nations.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-26-026-006" data-verse-ref="KJV.26.026.006"><span class="verse-number">6</span>And her daughters which are in the field shall be slain by the sword; and they shall know that I am the LORD.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-26-026-016" data-verse-ref="KJV.26.026.016"><span class="verse-number">16</span>Then all the princes of the sea shall come down from their thrones, and lay away their robes, and put off their broidered garments: they shall clothe themselves with trembling; they shall sit upon the ground, and shall tremble at every moment, and be astonished at thee.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-26-026-017" data-verse-ref="KJV.26.026.017"><span class="verse-number">17</span>And they shall take up a lamentation for thee, and say to thee, How art thou destroyed, that wast inhabited of seafaring men, the renowned city, which wast strong in the sea, she and her inhabitants, which cause their terror to be on all that haunt it!</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-26-026-018" data-verse-ref="KJV.26.026.018"><span class="verse-number">18</span>Now shall the isles tremble in the day of thy fall; yea, the isles that are in the sea shall be troubled at thy departure.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-26-026-019" data-verse-ref="KJV.26.026.019"><span class="verse-number">19</span>For thus saith the Lord GOD; When I shall make thee a desolate city, like the cities that are not inhabited; when I shall bring up the deep upon thee, and great waters shall cover thee;</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-26-026-020" data-verse-ref="KJV.26.026.020"><span class="verse-number">20</span>When I shall bring thee down with them that descend into the pit, with the people of old time, and shall set thee in the low parts of the earth, in places desolate of old, with them that go down to the pit, that thou be not inhabited; and I shall set glory in the land of the living;</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-26-026-021" data-verse-ref="KJV.26.026.021"><span class="verse-number">21</span>I will make thee a terror, and thou shalt be no more: though thou be sought for, yet shalt thou never be found again, saith the Lord GOD.</p>
