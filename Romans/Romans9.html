            <p class="verse" id="v-45-009-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.009.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>That I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-009-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.009.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>For I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-009-004" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.009.004"><span class="verse-number">4</span>Who are Israelites; to whom pertaineth the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service of God, and the promises;</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-009-005" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.009.005"><span class="verse-number">5</span>Whose are the fathers, and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came, who is over all, God blessed for ever. Amen.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-009-006" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.009.006"><span class="verse-number">6</span>Not as though the word of God hath taken none effect. For they are not all Israel, which are of Israel:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-009-007" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.009.007"><span class="verse-number">7</span>Neither, because they are the seed of Abraham, are they all children: but, In Isaac shall thy seed be called.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-009-008" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.009.008"><span class="verse-number">8</span>That is, They which are the children of the flesh, these are not the children of God: but the children of the promise are counted for the seed.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-009-009" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.009.009"><span class="verse-number">9</span>For this is the word of promise, At this time will I come, and Sara shall have a son.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-45-009-015" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.009.015"><span class="verse-number">15</span>For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-009-016" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.009.016"><span class="verse-number">16</span>So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-009-017" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.009.017"><span class="verse-number">17</span>For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, Even for this same purpose have I raised thee up, that I might shew my power in thee, and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-009-018" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.009.018"><span class="verse-number">18</span>Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-45-009-020" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.009.020"><span class="verse-number">20</span>Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why hast thou made me thus?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-009-021" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.009.021"><span class="verse-number">21</span>Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-009-022" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.009.022"><span class="verse-number">22</span>What if God, willing to shew his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-009-023" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.009.023"><span class="verse-number">23</span>And that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy, which he had afore prepared unto glory,</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-009-024" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.009.024"><span class="verse-number">24</span>Even us, whom he hath called, not of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-009-025" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.009.025"><span class="verse-number">25</span>As he saith also in Osee, I will call them my people, which were not my people; and her beloved, which was not beloved.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-009-026" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.009.026"><span class="verse-number">26</span>And it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said unto them, Ye are not my people; there shall they be called the children of the living God.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-009-027" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.009.027"><span class="verse-number">27</span>Esaias also crieth concerning Israel, Though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall be saved:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-009-028" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.009.028"><span class="verse-number">28</span>For he will finish the work, and cut it short in righteousness: because a short work will the Lord make upon the earth.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-009-029" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.009.029"><span class="verse-number">29</span>And as Esaias said before, Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed, we had been as Sodoma, and been made like unto Gomorrha.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-009-030" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.009.030"><span class="verse-number">30</span>What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, which followed not after righteousness, have attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-009-031" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.009.031"><span class="verse-number">31</span>But Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness, hath not attained to the law of righteousness.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-009-032" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.009.032"><span class="verse-number">32</span>Wherefore? Because they sought it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law. For they stumbled at that stumblingstone;</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-009-033" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.009.033"><span class="verse-number">33</span>As it is written, Behold, I lay in Sion a stumblingstone and rock of offence: and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.</p>
