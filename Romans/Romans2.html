            <p class="verse" id="v-45-002-004" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.002.004"><span class="verse-number">4</span>Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance?</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-45-002-024" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.002.024"><span class="verse-number">24</span>For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you, as it is written.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-002-025" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.002.025"><span class="verse-number">25</span>For circumcision verily profiteth, if thou keep the law: but if thou be a breaker of the law, thy circumcision is made uncircumcision.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-45-002-027" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.002.027"><span class="verse-number">27</span>And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfil the law, judge thee, who by the letter and circumcision dost transgress the law?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-002-028" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.002.028"><span class="verse-number">28</span>For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither is that circumcision, which is outward in the flesh:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-002-029" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.002.029"><span class="verse-number">29</span>But he is a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God.</p>
