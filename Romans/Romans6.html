            <p class="verse" id="v-45-006-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.006.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-006-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.006.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-006-004" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.006.004"><span class="verse-number">4</span>Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-006-005" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.006.005"><span class="verse-number">5</span>For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-006-006" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.006.006"><span class="verse-number">6</span>Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-006-007" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.006.007"><span class="verse-number">7</span>For he that is dead is freed from sin.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-006-008" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.006.008"><span class="verse-number">8</span>Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-006-009" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.006.009"><span class="verse-number">9</span>Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-006-010" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.006.010"><span class="verse-number">10</span>For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-006-011" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.006.011"><span class="verse-number">11</span>Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-006-012" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.006.012"><span class="verse-number">12</span>Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-45-006-014" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.006.014"><span class="verse-number">14</span>For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-006-015" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.006.015"><span class="verse-number">15</span>What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-006-016" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.006.016"><span class="verse-number">16</span>Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-006-017" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.006.017"><span class="verse-number">17</span>But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-006-018" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.006.018"><span class="verse-number">18</span>Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of righteousness.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-006-019" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.006.019"><span class="verse-number">19</span>I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-006-020" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.006.020"><span class="verse-number">20</span>For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-006-021" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.006.021"><span class="verse-number">21</span>What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of those things is death.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-006-022" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.006.022"><span class="verse-number">22</span>But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-006-023" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.006.023"><span class="verse-number">23</span>For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>
