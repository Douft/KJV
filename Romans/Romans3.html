            <p class="verse" id="v-45-003-001" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.003.001"><span class="verse-number">1</span>What advantage then hath the Jew? or what profit is there of circumcision?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-003-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.003.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>Much every way: chiefly, because that unto them were committed the oracles of God.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-003-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.003.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-003-004" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.003.004"><span class="verse-number">4</span>God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings, and mightest overcome when thou art judged.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-003-005" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.003.005"><span class="verse-number">5</span>But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is God unrighteous who taketh vengeance? (I speak as a man)</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-003-006" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.003.006"><span class="verse-number">6</span>God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-003-007" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.003.007"><span class="verse-number">7</span>For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie unto his glory; why yet am I also judged as a sinner?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-003-008" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.003.008"><span class="verse-number">8</span>And not rather, (as we be slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say,) Let us do evil, that good may come? whose damnation is just.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-003-009" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.003.009"><span class="verse-number">9</span>What then? are we better than they? No, in no wise: for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin;</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-003-010" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.003.010"><span class="verse-number">10</span>As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-003-011" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.003.011"><span class="verse-number">11</span>There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-45-003-013" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.003.013"><span class="verse-number">13</span>Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-003-014" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.003.014"><span class="verse-number">14</span>Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-003-015" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.003.015"><span class="verse-number">15</span>Their feet are swift to shed blood:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-003-016" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.003.016"><span class="verse-number">16</span>Destruction and misery are in their ways:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-003-017" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.003.017"><span class="verse-number">17</span>And the way of peace have they not known:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-003-018" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.003.018"><span class="verse-number">18</span>There is no fear of God before their eyes.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-003-019" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.003.019"><span class="verse-number">19</span>Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-003-020" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.003.020"><span class="verse-number">20</span>Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-003-021" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.003.021"><span class="verse-number">21</span>But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-003-022" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.003.022"><span class="verse-number">22</span>Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-003-023" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.003.023"><span class="verse-number">23</span>For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-003-024" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.003.024"><span class="verse-number">24</span>Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-003-025" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.003.025"><span class="verse-number">25</span>Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-003-026" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.003.026"><span class="verse-number">26</span>To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-003-027" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.003.027"><span class="verse-number">27</span>Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but by the law of faith.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-003-028" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.003.028"><span class="verse-number">28</span>Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-003-029" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.003.029"><span class="verse-number">29</span>Is he the God of the Jews only? is he not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-003-030" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.003.030"><span class="verse-number">30</span>Seeing it is one God, which shall justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-003-031" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.003.031"><span class="verse-number">31</span>Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law.</p>
