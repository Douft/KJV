            <p class="verse" id="v-45-014-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.014.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>For one believeth that he may eat all things: another, who is weak, eateth herbs.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-014-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.014.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not; and let not him which eateth not judge him that eateth: for God hath received him.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-014-004" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.014.004"><span class="verse-number">4</span>Who art thou that judgest another man's servant? to his own master he standeth or falleth. Yea, he shall be holden up: for God is able to make him stand.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-014-005" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.014.005"><span class="verse-number">5</span>One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every day alike. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-014-006" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.014.006"><span class="verse-number">6</span>He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord; and he that regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard it. He that eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-014-007" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.014.007"><span class="verse-number">7</span>For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-014-008" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.014.008"><span class="verse-number">8</span>For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord's.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-014-009" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.014.009"><span class="verse-number">9</span>For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-014-010" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.014.010"><span class="verse-number">10</span>But why dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost thou set at nought thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-014-011" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.014.011"><span class="verse-number">11</span>For it is written, As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-014-012" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.014.012"><span class="verse-number">12</span>So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-014-013" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.014.013"><span class="verse-number">13</span>Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge this rather, that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in his brother's way.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-014-014" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.014.014"><span class="verse-number">14</span>I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that there is nothing unclean of itself: but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean, to him it is unclean.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-014-015" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.014.015"><span class="verse-number">15</span>But if thy brother be grieved with thy meat, now walkest thou not charitably. Destroy not him with thy meat, for whom Christ died.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-014-016" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.014.016"><span class="verse-number">16</span>Let not then your good be evil spoken of:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-014-017" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.014.017"><span class="verse-number">17</span>For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-014-018" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.014.018"><span class="verse-number">18</span>For he that in these things serveth Christ is acceptable to God, and approved of men.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-014-019" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.014.019"><span class="verse-number">19</span>Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace, and things wherewith one may edify another.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-014-020" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.014.020"><span class="verse-number">20</span>For meat destroy not the work of God. All things indeed are pure; but it is evil for that man who eateth with offence.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-014-021" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.014.021"><span class="verse-number">21</span>It is good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor any thing whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-014-022" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.014.022"><span class="verse-number">22</span>Hast thou faith? have it to thyself before God. Happy is he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-014-023" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.014.023"><span class="verse-number">23</span>And he that doubteth is damned if he eat, because he eateth not of faith: for whatsoever is not of faith is sin.</p>
