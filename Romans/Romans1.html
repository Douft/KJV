            <p class="verse" id="v-45-001-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.001.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>(Which he had promised afore by his prophets in the holy scriptures,)</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-001-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.001.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh;</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-001-004" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.001.004"><span class="verse-number">4</span>And declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-001-005" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.001.005"><span class="verse-number">5</span>By whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith among all nations, for his name:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-001-006" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.001.006"><span class="verse-number">6</span>Among whom are ye also the called of Jesus Christ:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-001-007" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.001.007"><span class="verse-number">7</span>To all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called to be saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-001-008" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.001.008"><span class="verse-number">8</span>First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-001-009" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.001.009"><span class="verse-number">9</span>For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers;</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-001-010" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.001.010"><span class="verse-number">10</span>Making request, if by any means now at length I might have a prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-001-011" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.001.011"><span class="verse-number">11</span>For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift, to the end ye may be established;</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-001-012" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.001.012"><span class="verse-number">12</span>That is, that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-001-013" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.001.013"><span class="verse-number">13</span>Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes I purposed to come unto you, (but was let hitherto,) that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-001-014" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.001.014"><span class="verse-number">14</span>I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians; both to the wise, and to the unwise.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-001-015" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.001.015"><span class="verse-number">15</span>So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-001-016" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.001.016"><span class="verse-number">16</span>For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-001-017" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.001.017"><span class="verse-number">17</span>For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-001-018" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.001.018"><span class="verse-number">18</span>For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-001-019" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.001.019"><span class="verse-number">19</span>Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed it unto them.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-001-020" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.001.020"><span class="verse-number">20</span>For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-001-021" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.001.021"><span class="verse-number">21</span>Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-001-022" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.001.022"><span class="verse-number">22</span>Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-001-023" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.001.023"><span class="verse-number">23</span>And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-001-024" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.001.024"><span class="verse-number">24</span>Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-001-025" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.001.025"><span class="verse-number">25</span>Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-001-026" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.001.026"><span class="verse-number">26</span>For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-001-027" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.001.027"><span class="verse-number">27</span>And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-001-028" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.001.028"><span class="verse-number">28</span>And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-001-029" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.001.029"><span class="verse-number">29</span>Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-001-030" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.001.030"><span class="verse-number">30</span>Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-001-031" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.001.031"><span class="verse-number">31</span>Without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-001-032" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.001.032"><span class="verse-number">32</span>Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.</p>
