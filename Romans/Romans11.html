            <p class="verse" id="v-45-011-001" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.011.001"><span class="verse-number">1</span>I say then, Hath God cast away his people? God forbid. For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-011-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.011.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>God hath not cast away his people which he foreknew. Wot ye not what the scripture saith of Elias? how he maketh intercession to God against Israel, saying,</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-011-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.011.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>Lord, they have killed thy prophets, and digged down thine altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-011-004" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.011.004"><span class="verse-number">4</span>But what saith the answer of God unto him? I have reserved to myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to the image of Baal.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-011-005" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.011.005"><span class="verse-number">5</span>Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-011-006" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.011.006"><span class="verse-number">6</span>And if by grace, then is it no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace. But if it be of works, then is it no more grace: otherwise work is no more work.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-011-007" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.011.007"><span class="verse-number">7</span>What then? Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for; but the election hath obtained it, and the rest were blinded</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-011-008" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.011.008"><span class="verse-number">8</span>(According as it is written, God hath given them the spirit of slumber, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear;) unto this day.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-011-009" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.011.009"><span class="verse-number">9</span>And David saith, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, and a stumblingblock, and a recompence unto them:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-011-010" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.011.010"><span class="verse-number">10</span>Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, and bow down their back alway.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-011-011" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.011.011"><span class="verse-number">11</span>I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall? God forbid: but rather through their fall salvation is come unto the Gentiles, for to provoke them to jealousy.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-011-012" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.011.012"><span class="verse-number">12</span>Now if the fall of them be the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fulness?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-011-013" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.011.013"><span class="verse-number">13</span>For I speak to you Gentiles, inasmuch as I am the apostle of the Gentiles, I magnify mine office:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-011-014" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.011.014"><span class="verse-number">14</span>If by any means I may provoke to emulation them which are my flesh, and might save some of them.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-011-015" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.011.015"><span class="verse-number">15</span>For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world, what shall the receiving of them be, but life from the dead?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-011-016" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.011.016"><span class="verse-number">16</span>For if the firstfruit be holy, the lump is also holy: and if the root be holy, so are the branches.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-011-017" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.011.017"><span class="verse-number">17</span>And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou, being a wild olive tree, wert graffed in among them, and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree;</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-011-018" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.011.018"><span class="verse-number">18</span>Boast not against the branches. But if thou boast, thou bearest not the root, but the root thee.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-011-019" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.011.019"><span class="verse-number">19</span>Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken off, that I might be graffed in.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-011-020" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.011.020"><span class="verse-number">20</span>Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by faith. Be not highminded, but fear:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-011-021" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.011.021"><span class="verse-number">21</span>For if God spared not the natural branches, take heed lest he also spare not thee.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-011-022" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.011.022"><span class="verse-number">22</span>Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them which fell, severity; but toward thee, goodness, if thou continue in his goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-011-023" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.011.023"><span class="verse-number">23</span>And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be graffed in: for God is able to graff them in again.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-011-024" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.011.024"><span class="verse-number">24</span>For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature, and wert graffed contrary to nature into a good olive tree: how much more shall these, which be the natural branches, be graffed into their own olive tree?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-011-025" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.011.025"><span class="verse-number">25</span>For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-011-026" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.011.026"><span class="verse-number">26</span>And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-011-027" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.011.027"><span class="verse-number">27</span>For this is my covenant unto them, when I shall take away their sins.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-011-028" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.011.028"><span class="verse-number">28</span>As concerning the gospel, they are enemies for your sakes: but as touching the election, they are beloved for the fathers' sakes.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-011-029" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.011.029"><span class="verse-number">29</span>For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-011-030" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.011.030"><span class="verse-number">30</span>For as ye in times past have not believed God, yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-011-031" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.011.031"><span class="verse-number">31</span>Even so have these also now not believed, that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-011-032" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.011.032"><span class="verse-number">32</span>For God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-011-033" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.011.033"><span class="verse-number">33</span>O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out!</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-011-034" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.011.034"><span class="verse-number">34</span>For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his counseller?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-011-035" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.011.035"><span class="verse-number">35</span>Or who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-011-036" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.011.036"><span class="verse-number">36</span>For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things: to whom be glory for ever. Amen.</p>
