            <p class="verse" id="v-45-007-001" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.007.001"><span class="verse-number">1</span>Know ye not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the law,) how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-007-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.007.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of her husband.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-007-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.007.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>So then if, while her husband liveth, she be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if her husband be dead, she is free from that law; so that she is no adulteress, though she be married to another man.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-007-004" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.007.004"><span class="verse-number">4</span>Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ; that ye should be married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-007-005" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.007.005"><span class="verse-number">5</span>For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins, which were by the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-007-006" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.007.006"><span class="verse-number">6</span>But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-007-007" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.007.007"><span class="verse-number">7</span>What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-007-008" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.007.008"><span class="verse-number">8</span>But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence. For without the law sin was dead.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-007-009" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.007.009"><span class="verse-number">9</span>For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-007-010" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.007.010"><span class="verse-number">10</span>And the commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to be unto death.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-007-011" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.007.011"><span class="verse-number">11</span>For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-007-012" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.007.012"><span class="verse-number">12</span>Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-007-013" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.007.013"><span class="verse-number">13</span>Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-007-014" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.007.014"><span class="verse-number">14</span>For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-007-015" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.007.015"><span class="verse-number">15</span>For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-007-016" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.007.016"><span class="verse-number">16</span>If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that it is good.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-007-017" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.007.017"><span class="verse-number">17</span>Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-007-018" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.007.018"><span class="verse-number">18</span>For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me; but how to perform that which is good I find not.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-007-019" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.007.019"><span class="verse-number">19</span>For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-007-020" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.007.020"><span class="verse-number">20</span>Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-007-021" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.007.021"><span class="verse-number">21</span>I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with me.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-007-022" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.007.022"><span class="verse-number">22</span>For I delight in the law of God after the inward man:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-007-023" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.007.023"><span class="verse-number">23</span>But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-007-024" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.007.024"><span class="verse-number">24</span>O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-45-007-025" data-verse-ref="KJV.45.007.025"><span class="verse-number">25</span>I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin.</p>
