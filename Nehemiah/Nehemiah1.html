            <p class="verse" id="v-16-001-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.16.001.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>That Hanani, one of my brethren, came, he and certain men of Judah; and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped, which were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-16-001-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.16.001.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>And they said unto me, The remnant that are left of the captivity there in the province are in great affliction and reproach: the wall of Jerusalem also is broken down, and the gates thereof are burned with fire.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-16-001-004" data-verse-ref="KJV.16.001.004"><span class="verse-number">4</span>And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned certain days, and fasted, and prayed before the God of heaven,</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-16-001-005" data-verse-ref="KJV.16.001.005"><span class="verse-number">5</span>And said, I beseech thee, O LORD God of heaven, the great and terrible God, that keepeth covenant and mercy for them that love him and observe his commandments:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-16-001-006" data-verse-ref="KJV.16.001.006"><span class="verse-number">6</span>Let thine ear now be attentive, and thine eyes open, that thou mayest hear the prayer of thy servant, which I pray before thee now, day and night, for the children of Israel thy servants, and confess the sins of the children of Israel, which we have sinned against thee: both I and my father's house have sinned.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-16-001-007" data-verse-ref="KJV.16.001.007"><span class="verse-number">7</span>We have dealt very corruptly against thee, and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the judgments, which thou commandedst thy servant Moses.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-16-001-008" data-verse-ref="KJV.16.001.008"><span class="verse-number">8</span>Remember, I beseech thee, the word that thou commandedst thy servant Moses, saying, If ye transgress, I will scatter you abroad among the nations:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-16-001-009" data-verse-ref="KJV.16.001.009"><span class="verse-number">9</span>But if ye turn unto me, and keep my commandments, and do them; though there were of you cast out unto the uttermost part of the heaven, yet will I gather them from thence, and will bring them unto the place that I have chosen to set my name there.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-16-001-010" data-verse-ref="KJV.16.001.010"><span class="verse-number">10</span>Now these are thy servants and thy people, whom thou hast redeemed by thy great power, and by thy strong hand.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-16-001-011" data-verse-ref="KJV.16.001.011"><span class="verse-number">11</span>O Lord, I beseech thee, let now thine ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants, who desire to fear thy name: and prosper, I pray thee, thy servant this day, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man. For I was the king's cupbearer.</p>
