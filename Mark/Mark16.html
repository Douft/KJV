            <p class="verse" id="v-41-016-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.016.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>And very early in the morning the first day of the week, they came unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-41-016-006" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.016.006"><span class="verse-number">6</span>And he saith unto them, Be not affrighted: Ye seek Jesus of Nazareth, which was crucified: he is risen; he is not here: behold the place where they laid him.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-41-016-007" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.016.007"><span class="verse-number">7</span>But go your way, tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth before you into Galilee: there shall ye see him, as he said unto you.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-41-016-015" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.016.015"><span class="verse-number">15</span>And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.</p>
