            <p class="verse" id="v-41-004-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.004.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>And he taught them many things by parables, and said unto them in his doctrine,</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-41-004-004" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.004.004"><span class="verse-number">4</span>And it came to pass, as he sowed, some fell by the way side, and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-41-004-005" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.004.005"><span class="verse-number">5</span>And some fell on stony ground, where it had not much earth; and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of earth:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-41-004-006" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.004.006"><span class="verse-number">6</span>But when the sun was up, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-41-004-018" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.004.018"><span class="verse-number">18</span>And these are they which are sown among thorns; such as hear the word,</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-41-004-019" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.004.019"><span class="verse-number">19</span>And the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-41-004-020" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.004.020"><span class="verse-number">20</span>And these are they which are sown on good ground; such as hear the word, and receive it, and bring forth fruit, some thirtyfold, some sixty, and some an hundred.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-41-004-022" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.004.022"><span class="verse-number">22</span>For there is nothing hid, which shall not be manifested; neither was any thing kept secret, but that it should come abroad.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-41-004-025" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.004.025"><span class="verse-number">25</span>For he that hath, to him shall be given: and he that hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he hath.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-41-004-026" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.004.026"><span class="verse-number">26</span>And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the ground;</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-41-004-027" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.004.027"><span class="verse-number">27</span>And should sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed should spring and grow up, he knoweth not how.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-41-004-028" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.004.028"><span class="verse-number">28</span>For the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself; first the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-41-004-029" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.004.029"><span class="verse-number">29</span>But when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he putteth in the sickle, because the harvest is come.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-41-004-030" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.004.030"><span class="verse-number">30</span>And he said, Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God? or with what comparison shall we compare it?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-41-004-031" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.004.031"><span class="verse-number">31</span>It is like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, is less than all the seeds that be in the earth:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-41-004-032" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.004.032"><span class="verse-number">32</span>But when it is sown, it groweth up, and becometh greater than all herbs, and shooteth out great branches; so that the fowls of the air may lodge under the shadow of it.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-41-004-033" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.004.033"><span class="verse-number">33</span>And with many such parables spake he the word unto them, as they were able to hear it.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-41-004-034" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.004.034"><span class="verse-number">34</span>But without a parable spake he not unto them: and when they were alone, he expounded all things to his disciples.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-41-004-035" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.004.035"><span class="verse-number">35</span>And the same day, when the even was come, he saith unto them, Let us pass over unto the other side.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-41-004-036" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.004.036"><span class="verse-number">36</span>And when they had sent away the multitude, they took him even as he was in the ship. And there were also with him other little ships.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-41-004-037" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.004.037"><span class="verse-number">37</span>And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so that it was now full.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-41-004-038" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.004.038"><span class="verse-number">38</span>And he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow: and they awake him, and say unto him, Master, carest thou not that we perish?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-41-004-039" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.004.039"><span class="verse-number">39</span>And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-41-004-040" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.004.040"><span class="verse-number">40</span>And he said unto them, Why are ye so fearful? how is it that ye have no faith?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-41-004-041" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.004.041"><span class="verse-number">41</span>And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, What manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?</p>
