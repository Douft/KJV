            <p class="verse" id="v-41-011-024" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.011.024"><span class="verse-number">24</span>Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-41-011-025" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.011.025"><span class="verse-number">25</span>And when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have ought against any: that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-41-011-026" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.011.026"><span class="verse-number">26</span>But if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses.</p>
