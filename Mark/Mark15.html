            <p class="verse" id="v-41-015-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.015.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answering said unto him, Thou sayest it.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-41-015-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.015.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>And the chief priests accused him of many things: but he answered nothing.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-41-015-004" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.015.004"><span class="verse-number">4</span>And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answerest thou nothing? behold how many things they witness against thee.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-41-015-005" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.015.005"><span class="verse-number">5</span>But Jesus yet answered nothing; so that Pilate marvelled.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-41-015-006" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.015.006"><span class="verse-number">6</span>Now at that feast he released unto them one prisoner, whomsoever they desired.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-41-015-007" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.015.007"><span class="verse-number">7</span>And there was one named Barabbas, which lay bound with them that had made insurrection with him, who had committed murder in the insurrection.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-41-015-008" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.015.008"><span class="verse-number">8</span>And the multitude crying aloud began to desire him to do as he had ever done unto them.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-41-015-009" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.015.009"><span class="verse-number">9</span>But Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-41-015-010" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.015.010"><span class="verse-number">10</span>For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-41-015-011" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.015.011"><span class="verse-number">11</span>But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather release Barabbas unto them.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-41-015-012" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.015.012"><span class="verse-number">12</span>And Pilate answered and said again unto them, What will ye then that I shall do unto him whom ye call the King of the Jews?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-41-015-013" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.015.013"><span class="verse-number">13</span>And they cried out again, Crucify him.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-41-015-015" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.015.015"><span class="verse-number">15</span>And so Pilate, willing to content the people, released Barabbas unto them, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged him, to be crucified.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-41-015-016" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.015.016"><span class="verse-number">16</span>And the soldiers led him away into the hall, called Praetorium; and they call together the whole band.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-41-015-018" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.015.018"><span class="verse-number">18</span>And began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews!</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-41-015-019" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.015.019"><span class="verse-number">19</span>And they smote him on the head with a reed, and did spit upon him, and bowing their knees worshipped him.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-41-015-020" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.015.020"><span class="verse-number">20</span>And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to crucify him.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-41-015-021" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.015.021"><span class="verse-number">21</span>And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming out of the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear his cross.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-41-015-024" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.015.024"><span class="verse-number">24</span>And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-41-015-025" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.015.025"><span class="verse-number">25</span>And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-41-015-027" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.015.027"><span class="verse-number">27</span>And with him they crucify two thieves; the one on his right hand, and the other on his left.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-41-015-028" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.015.028"><span class="verse-number">28</span>And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, And he was numbered with the transgressors.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-41-015-029" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.015.029"><span class="verse-number">29</span>And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ah, thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days,</p>
