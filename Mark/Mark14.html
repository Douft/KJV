            <p class="verse" id="v-41-014-022" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.014.022"><span class="verse-number">22</span>And as they did eat, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and brake it, and gave to them, and said, Take, eat: this is my body.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-41-014-023" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.014.023"><span class="verse-number">23</span>And he took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them: and they all drank of it.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-41-014-024" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.014.024"><span class="verse-number">24</span>And he said unto them, This is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-41-014-029" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.014.029"><span class="verse-number">29</span>But Peter said unto him, Although all shall be offended, yet will not I.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-41-014-030" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.014.030"><span class="verse-number">30</span>And Jesus saith unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this day, even in this night, before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-41-014-031" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.014.031"><span class="verse-number">31</span>But he spake the more vehemently, If I should die with thee, I will not deny thee in any wise. Likewise also said they all.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-41-014-032" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.014.032"><span class="verse-number">32</span>And they came to a place which was named Gethsemane: and he saith to his disciples, Sit ye here, while I shall pray.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-41-014-035" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.014.035"><span class="verse-number">35</span>And he went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-41-014-036" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.014.036"><span class="verse-number">36</span>And he said, Abba, Father, all things are possible unto thee; take away this cup from me: nevertheless not what I will, but what thou wilt.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-41-014-052" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.014.052"><span class="verse-number">52</span>And he left the linen cloth, and fled from them naked.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-41-014-053" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.014.053"><span class="verse-number">53</span>And they led Jesus away to the high priest: and with him were assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-41-014-054" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.014.054"><span class="verse-number">54</span>And Peter followed him afar off, even into the palace of the high priest: and he sat with the servants, and warmed himself at the fire.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-41-014-055" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.014.055"><span class="verse-number">55</span>And the chief priests and all the council sought for witness against Jesus to put him to death; and found none.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-41-014-060" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.014.060"><span class="verse-number">60</span>And the high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus, saying, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-41-014-061" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.014.061"><span class="verse-number">61</span>But he held his peace, and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him, and said unto him, Art thou the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-41-014-062" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.014.062"><span class="verse-number">62</span>And Jesus said, I am: and ye shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-41-014-063" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.014.063"><span class="verse-number">63</span>Then the high priest rent his clothes, and saith, What need we any further witnesses?</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-41-014-065" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.014.065"><span class="verse-number">65</span>And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to buffet him, and to say unto him, Prophesy: and the servants did strike him with the palms of their hands.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-41-014-066" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.014.066"><span class="verse-number">66</span>And as Peter was beneath in the palace, there cometh one of the maids of the high priest:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-41-014-067" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.014.067"><span class="verse-number">67</span>And when she saw Peter warming himself, she looked upon him, and said, And thou also wast with Jesus of Nazareth.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-41-014-068" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.014.068"><span class="verse-number">68</span>But he denied, saying, I know not, neither understand I what thou sayest. And he went out into the porch; and the cock crew.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-41-014-069" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.014.069"><span class="verse-number">69</span>And a maid saw him again, and began to say to them that stood by, This is one of them.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-41-014-070" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.014.070"><span class="verse-number">70</span>And he denied it again. And a little after, they that stood by said again to Peter, Surely thou art one of them: for thou art a Galilaean, and thy speech agreeth thereto.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-41-014-071" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.014.071"><span class="verse-number">71</span>But he began to curse and to swear, saying, I know not this man of whom ye speak.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-41-014-072" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.014.072"><span class="verse-number">72</span>And the second time the cock crew. And Peter called to mind the word that Jesus said unto him, Before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice. And when he thought thereon, he wept.</p>
