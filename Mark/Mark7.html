            <p class="verse" id="v-41-007-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.007.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>And when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled, that is to say, with unwashen, hands, they found fault.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-41-007-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.007.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash their hands oft, eat not, holding the tradition of the elders.</p>

And many other things there be, which they have received to hold, as the washing of cups, and pots, brasen vessels, and of tables.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-41-007-005" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.007.005"><span class="verse-number">5</span>Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, Why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashen hands?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-41-007-006" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.007.006"><span class="verse-number">6</span>He answered and said unto them, Well hath Esaias prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-41-007-008" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.007.008"><span class="verse-number">8</span>For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of men, as the washing of pots and cups: and many other such like things ye do.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-41-007-009" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.007.009"><span class="verse-number">9</span>And he said unto them, Full well ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-41-007-017" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.007.017"><span class="verse-number">17</span>And when he was entered into the house from the people, his disciples asked him concerning the parable.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-41-007-018" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.007.018"><span class="verse-number">18</span>And he saith unto them, Are ye so without understanding also? Do ye not perceive, that whatsoever thing from without entereth into the man, it cannot defile him;</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-41-007-019" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.007.019"><span class="verse-number">19</span>Because it entereth not into his heart, but into the belly, and goeth out into the draught, purging all meats?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-41-007-020" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.007.020"><span class="verse-number">20</span>And he said, That which cometh out of the man, that defileth the man.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-41-007-021" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.007.021"><span class="verse-number">21</span>For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders,</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-41-007-024" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.007.024"><span class="verse-number">24</span>And from thence he arose, and went into the borders of Tyre and Sidon, and entered into an house, and would have no man know it: but he could not be hid.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-41-007-025" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.007.025"><span class="verse-number">25</span>For a certain woman, whose young daughter had an unclean spirit, heard of him, and came and fell at his feet:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-41-007-026" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.007.026"><span class="verse-number">26</span>The woman was a Greek, a Syrophenician by nation; and she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-41-007-027" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.007.027"><span class="verse-number">27</span>But Jesus said unto her, Let the children first be filled: for it is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it unto the dogs.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-41-007-028" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.007.028"><span class="verse-number">28</span>And she answered and said unto him, Yes, Lord: yet the dogs under the table eat of the children's crumbs.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-41-007-029" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.007.029"><span class="verse-number">29</span>And he said unto her, For this saying go thy way; the devil is gone out of thy daughter.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-41-007-030" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.007.030"><span class="verse-number">30</span>And when she was come to her house, she found the devil gone out, and her daughter laid upon the bed.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-41-007-031" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.007.031"><span class="verse-number">31</span>And again, departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, he came unto the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-41-007-032" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.007.032"><span class="verse-number">32</span>And they bring unto him one that was deaf, and had an impediment in his speech; and they beseech him to put his hand upon him.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-41-007-033" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.007.033"><span class="verse-number">33</span>And he took him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spit, and touched his tongue;</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-41-007-034" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.007.034"><span class="verse-number">34</span>And looking up to heaven, he sighed, and saith unto him, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-41-007-035" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.007.035"><span class="verse-number">35</span>And straightway his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spake plain.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-41-007-036" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.007.036"><span class="verse-number">36</span>And he charged them that they should tell no man: but the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal they published it;</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-41-007-037" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.007.037"><span class="verse-number">37</span>And were beyond measure astonished, saying, He hath done all things well: he maketh both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak.</p>
