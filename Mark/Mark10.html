            <p class="verse" id="v-41-010-045" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.010.045"><span class="verse-number">45</span>For even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-41-010-046" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.010.046"><span class="verse-number">46</span>And they came to Jericho: and as he went out of Jericho with his disciples and a great number of people, blind Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus, sat by the highway side begging.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-41-010-047" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.010.047"><span class="verse-number">47</span>And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out, and say, Jesus, thou Son of David, have mercy on me.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-41-010-048" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.010.048"><span class="verse-number">48</span>And many charged him that he should hold his peace: but he cried the more a great deal, Thou Son of David, have mercy on me.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-41-010-049" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.010.049"><span class="verse-number">49</span>And Jesus stood still, and commanded him to be called. And they call the blind man, saying unto him, Be of good comfort, rise; he calleth thee.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-41-010-050" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.010.050"><span class="verse-number">50</span>And he, casting away his garment, rose, and came to Jesus.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-41-010-051" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.010.051"><span class="verse-number">51</span>And Jesus answered and said unto him, What wilt thou that I should do unto thee? The blind man said unto him, Lord, that I might receive my sight.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-41-010-052" data-verse-ref="KJV.41.010.052"><span class="verse-number">52</span>And Jesus said unto him, Go thy way; thy faith hath made thee whole. And immediately he received his sight, and followed Jesus in the way.</p>
