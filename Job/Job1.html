            <p class="verse" id="v-18-001-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.18.001.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-18-001-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.18.001.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-18-001-004" data-verse-ref="KJV.18.001.004"><span class="verse-number">4</span>And his sons went and feasted in their houses, every one his day; and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-18-001-005" data-verse-ref="KJV.18.001.005"><span class="verse-number">5</span>And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-18-001-006" data-verse-ref="KJV.18.001.006"><span class="verse-number">6</span>Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-18-001-007" data-verse-ref="KJV.18.001.007"><span class="verse-number">7</span>And the LORD said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-18-001-008" data-verse-ref="KJV.18.001.008"><span class="verse-number">8</span>And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-18-001-009" data-verse-ref="KJV.18.001.009"><span class="verse-number">9</span>Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, Doth Job fear God for nought?</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-18-001-018" data-verse-ref="KJV.18.001.018"><span class="verse-number">18</span>While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house:</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-18-001-020" data-verse-ref="KJV.18.001.020"><span class="verse-number">20</span>Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and worshipped,</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-18-001-021" data-verse-ref="KJV.18.001.021"><span class="verse-number">21</span>And said, Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither: the LORD gave, and the LORD hath taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD.</p>
