            <p class="verse" id="v-18-032-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.18.032.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the kindred of Ram: against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified himself rather than God.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-18-032-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.18.032.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-18-032-004" data-verse-ref="KJV.18.032.004"><span class="verse-number">4</span>Now Elihu had waited till Job had spoken, because they were elder than he.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-18-032-006" data-verse-ref="KJV.18.032.006"><span class="verse-number">6</span>And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I am young, and ye are very old; wherefore I was afraid, and durst not shew you mine opinion.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-18-032-007" data-verse-ref="KJV.18.032.007"><span class="verse-number">7</span>I said, Days should speak, and multitude of years should teach wisdom.</p>
