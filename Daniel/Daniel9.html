            <p class="verse" id="v-27-009-022" data-verse-ref="KJV.27.009.022"><span class="verse-number">22</span>And he informed me, and talked with me, and said, O Daniel, I am now come forth to give thee skill and understanding.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-27-009-023" data-verse-ref="KJV.27.009.023"><span class="verse-number">23</span>At the beginning of thy supplications the commandment came forth, and I am come to shew thee; for thou art greatly beloved: therefore understand the matter, and consider the vision.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-27-009-025" data-verse-ref="KJV.27.009.025"><span class="verse-number">25</span>Know therefore and understand, that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks, and threescore and two weeks: the street shall be built again, and the wall, even in troublous times.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-27-009-026" data-verse-ref="KJV.27.009.026"><span class="verse-number">26</span>And after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off, but not for himself: and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary; and the end thereof shall be with a flood, and unto the end of the war desolations are determined.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-27-009-027" data-verse-ref="KJV.27.009.027"><span class="verse-number">27</span>And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week: and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease, and for the overspreading of abominations he shall make it desolate, even until the consummation, and that determined shall be poured upon the desolate.</p>
