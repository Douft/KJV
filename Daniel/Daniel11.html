Behold, there shall stand up yet three kings in Persia; and the fourth shall be far richer than they all: and by his strength through his riches he shall stir up all against the realm of Grecia.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-27-011-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.27.011.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>And a mighty king shall stand up, that shall rule with great dominion, and do according to his will.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-27-011-005" data-verse-ref="KJV.27.011.005"><span class="verse-number">5</span>And the king of the south shall be strong, and one of his princes; and he shall be strong above him, and have dominion; his dominion shall be a great dominion.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-27-011-006" data-verse-ref="KJV.27.011.006"><span class="verse-number">6</span>And in the end of years they shall join themselves together; for the king's daughter of the south shall come to the king of the north to make an agreement: but she shall not retain the power of the arm; neither shall he stand, nor his arm: but she shall be given up, and they that brought her, and he that begat her, and he that strengthened her in these times.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-27-011-007" data-verse-ref="KJV.27.011.007"><span class="verse-number">7</span>But out of a branch of her roots shall one stand up in his estate, which shall come with an army, and shall enter into the fortress of the king of the north, and shall deal against them, and shall prevail:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-27-011-008" data-verse-ref="KJV.27.011.008"><span class="verse-number">8</span>And shall also carry captives into Egypt their gods, with their princes, and with their precious vessels of silver and of gold; and he shall continue more years than the king of the north.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-27-011-009" data-verse-ref="KJV.27.011.009"><span class="verse-number">9</span>So the king of the south shall come into his kingdom, and shall return into his own land.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-27-011-018" data-verse-ref="KJV.27.011.018"><span class="verse-number">18</span>After this shall he turn his face unto the isles, and shall take many: but a prince for his own behalf shall cause the reproach offered by him to cease; without his own reproach he shall cause it to turn upon him.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-27-011-019" data-verse-ref="KJV.27.011.019"><span class="verse-number">19</span>Then he shall turn his face toward the fort of his own land: but he shall stumble and fall, and not be found.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-27-011-020" data-verse-ref="KJV.27.011.020"><span class="verse-number">20</span>Then shall stand up in his estate a raiser of taxes in the glory of the kingdom: but within few days he shall be destroyed, neither in anger, nor in battle.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-27-011-021" data-verse-ref="KJV.27.011.021"><span class="verse-number">21</span>And in his estate shall stand up a vile person, to whom they shall not give the honour of the kingdom: but he shall come in peaceably, and obtain the kingdom by flatteries.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-27-011-022" data-verse-ref="KJV.27.011.022"><span class="verse-number">22</span>And with the arms of a flood shall they be overflown from before him, and shall be broken; yea, also the prince of the covenant.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-27-011-023" data-verse-ref="KJV.27.011.023"><span class="verse-number">23</span>And after the league made with him he shall work deceitfully: for he shall come up, and shall become strong with a small people.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-27-011-024" data-verse-ref="KJV.27.011.024"><span class="verse-number">24</span>He shall enter peaceably even upon the fattest places of the province; and he shall do that which his fathers have not done, nor his fathers' fathers; he shall scatter among them the prey, and spoil, and riches: yea, and he shall forecast his devices against the strong holds, even for a time.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-27-011-025" data-verse-ref="KJV.27.011.025"><span class="verse-number">25</span>And he shall stir up his power and his courage against the king of the south with a great army; and the king of the south shall be stirred up to battle with a very great and mighty army; but he shall not stand: for they shall forecast devices against him.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-27-011-026" data-verse-ref="KJV.27.011.026"><span class="verse-number">26</span>Yea, they that feed of the portion of his meat shall destroy him, and his army shall overflow: and many shall fall down slain.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-27-011-027" data-verse-ref="KJV.27.011.027"><span class="verse-number">27</span>And both these kings' hearts shall be to do mischief, and they shall speak lies at one table; but it shall not prosper: for yet the end shall be at the time appointed.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-27-011-028" data-verse-ref="KJV.27.011.028"><span class="verse-number">28</span>Then shall he return into his land with great riches; and his heart shall be against the holy covenant; and he shall do exploits, and return to his own land.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-27-011-029" data-verse-ref="KJV.27.011.029"><span class="verse-number">29</span>At the time appointed he shall return, and come toward the south; but it shall not be as the former, or as the latter.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-27-011-030" data-verse-ref="KJV.27.011.030"><span class="verse-number">30</span>For the ships of Chittim shall come against him: therefore he shall be grieved, and return, and have indignation against the holy covenant: so shall he do; he shall even return, and have intelligence with them that forsake the holy covenant.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-27-011-031" data-verse-ref="KJV.27.011.031"><span class="verse-number">31</span>And arms shall stand on his part, and they shall pollute the sanctuary of strength, and shall take away the daily sacrifice, and they shall place the abomination that maketh desolate.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-27-011-032" data-verse-ref="KJV.27.011.032"><span class="verse-number">32</span>And such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he corrupt by flatteries: but the people that do know their God shall be strong, and do exploits.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-27-011-033" data-verse-ref="KJV.27.011.033"><span class="verse-number">33</span>And they that understand among the people shall instruct many: yet they shall fall by the sword, and by flame, by captivity, and by spoil, many days.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-27-011-034" data-verse-ref="KJV.27.011.034"><span class="verse-number">34</span>Now when they shall fall, they shall be holpen with a little help: but many shall cleave to them with flatteries.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-27-011-037" data-verse-ref="KJV.27.011.037"><span class="verse-number">37</span>Neither shall he regard the God of his fathers, nor the desire of women, nor regard any god: for he shall magnify himself above all.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-27-011-038" data-verse-ref="KJV.27.011.038"><span class="verse-number">38</span>But in his estate shall he honour the God of forces: and a god whom his fathers knew not shall he honour with gold, and silver, and with precious stones, and pleasant things.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-27-011-039" data-verse-ref="KJV.27.011.039"><span class="verse-number">39</span>Thus shall he do in the most strong holds with a strange god, whom he shall acknowledge and increase with glory: and he shall cause them to rule over many, and shall divide the land for gain.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-27-011-040" data-verse-ref="KJV.27.011.040"><span class="verse-number">40</span>And at the time of the end shall the king of the south push at him: and the king of the north shall come against him like a whirlwind, with chariots, and with horsemen, and with many ships; and he shall enter into the countries, and shall overflow and pass over.</p>
