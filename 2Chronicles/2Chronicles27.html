            <p class="verse" id="v-14-027-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.14.027.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father Uzziah did: howbeit he entered not into the temple of the LORD. And the people did yet corruptly.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-14-027-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.14.027.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>He built the high gate of the house of the LORD, and on the wall of Ophel he built much.</p>
