            <p class="verse" id="v-14-029-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.14.029.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that David his father had done.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-14-029-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.14.029.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>He in the first year of his reign, in the first month, opened the doors of the house of the LORD, and repaired them.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-14-029-006" data-verse-ref="KJV.14.029.006"><span class="verse-number">6</span>For our fathers have trespassed, and done that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD our God, and have forsaken him, and have turned away their faces from the habitation of the LORD, and turned their backs.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-14-029-007" data-verse-ref="KJV.14.029.007"><span class="verse-number">7</span>Also they have shut up the doors of the porch, and put out the lamps, and have not burned incense nor offered burnt offerings in the holy place unto the God of Israel.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-14-029-008" data-verse-ref="KJV.14.029.008"><span class="verse-number">8</span>Wherefore the wrath of the LORD was upon Judah and Jerusalem, and he hath delivered them to trouble, to astonishment, and to hissing, as ye see with your eyes.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-14-029-009" data-verse-ref="KJV.14.029.009"><span class="verse-number">9</span>For, lo, our fathers have fallen by the sword, and our sons and our daughters and our wives are in captivity for this.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-14-029-016" data-verse-ref="KJV.14.029.016"><span class="verse-number">16</span>And the priests went into the inner part of the house of the LORD, to cleanse it, and brought out all the uncleanness that they found in the temple of the LORD into the court of the house of the LORD. And the Levites took it, to carry it out abroad into the brook Kidron.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-14-029-017" data-verse-ref="KJV.14.029.017"><span class="verse-number">17</span>Now they began on the first day of the first month to sanctify, and on the eighth day of the month came they to the porch of the LORD: so they sanctified the house of the LORD in eight days; and in the sixteenth day of the first month they made an end.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-14-029-018" data-verse-ref="KJV.14.029.018"><span class="verse-number">18</span>Then they went in to Hezekiah the king, and said, We have cleansed all the house of the LORD, and the altar of burnt offering, with all the vessels thereof, and the shewbread table, with all the vessels thereof.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-14-029-019" data-verse-ref="KJV.14.029.019"><span class="verse-number">19</span>Moreover all the vessels, which king Ahaz in his reign did cast away in his transgression, have we prepared and sanctified, and, behold, they are before the altar of the LORD.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-14-029-020" data-verse-ref="KJV.14.029.020"><span class="verse-number">20</span>Then Hezekiah the king rose early, and gathered the rulers of the city, and went up to the house of the LORD.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-14-029-021" data-verse-ref="KJV.14.029.021"><span class="verse-number">21</span>And they brought seven bullocks, and seven rams, and seven lambs, and seven he goats, for a sin offering for the kingdom, and for the sanctuary, and for Judah. And he commanded the priests the sons of Aaron to offer them on the altar of the LORD.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-14-029-022" data-verse-ref="KJV.14.029.022"><span class="verse-number">22</span>So they killed the bullocks, and the priests received the blood, and sprinkled it on the altar: likewise, when they had killed the rams, they sprinkled the blood upon the altar: they killed also the lambs, and they sprinkled the blood upon the altar.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-14-029-023" data-verse-ref="KJV.14.029.023"><span class="verse-number">23</span>And they brought forth the he goats for the sin offering before the king and the congregation; and they laid their hands upon them:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-14-029-024" data-verse-ref="KJV.14.029.024"><span class="verse-number">24</span>And the priests killed them, and they made reconciliation with their blood upon the altar, to make an atonement for all Israel: for the king commanded that the burnt offering and the sin offering should be made for all Israel.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-14-029-025" data-verse-ref="KJV.14.029.025"><span class="verse-number">25</span>And he set the Levites in the house of the LORD with cymbals, with psalteries, and with harps, according to the commandment of David, and of Gad the king's seer, and Nathan the prophet: for so was the commandment of the LORD by his prophets.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-14-029-026" data-verse-ref="KJV.14.029.026"><span class="verse-number">26</span>And the Levites stood with the instruments of David, and the priests with the trumpets.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-14-029-027" data-verse-ref="KJV.14.029.027"><span class="verse-number">27</span>And Hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt offering upon the altar. And when the burnt offering began, the song of the LORD began also with the trumpets, and with the instruments ordained by David king of Israel.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-14-029-028" data-verse-ref="KJV.14.029.028"><span class="verse-number">28</span>And all the congregation worshipped, and the singers sang, and the trumpeters sounded: and all this continued until the burnt offering was finished.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-14-029-029" data-verse-ref="KJV.14.029.029"><span class="verse-number">29</span>And when they had made an end of offering, the king and all that were present with him bowed themselves, and worshipped.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-14-029-030" data-verse-ref="KJV.14.029.030"><span class="verse-number">30</span>Moreover Hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the Levites to sing praise unto the LORD with the words of David, and of Asaph the seer. And they sang praises with gladness, and they bowed their heads and worshipped.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-14-029-031" data-verse-ref="KJV.14.029.031"><span class="verse-number">31</span>Then Hezekiah answered and said, Now ye have consecrated yourselves unto the LORD, come near and bring sacrifices and thank offerings into the house of the LORD. And the congregation brought in sacrifices and thank offerings; and as many as were of a free heart burnt offerings.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-14-029-032" data-verse-ref="KJV.14.029.032"><span class="verse-number">32</span>And the number of the burnt offerings, which the congregation brought, was threescore and ten bullocks, an hundred rams, and two hundred lambs: all these were for a burnt offering to the LORD.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-14-029-033" data-verse-ref="KJV.14.029.033"><span class="verse-number">33</span>And the consecrated things were six hundred oxen and three thousand sheep.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-14-029-034" data-verse-ref="KJV.14.029.034"><span class="verse-number">34</span>But the priests were too few, so that they could not flay all the burnt offerings: wherefore their brethren the Levites did help them, till the work was ended, and until the other priests had sanctified themselves: for the Levites were more upright in heart to sanctify themselves than the priests.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-14-029-035" data-verse-ref="KJV.14.029.035"><span class="verse-number">35</span>And also the burnt offerings were in abundance, with the fat of the peace offerings, and the drink offerings for every burnt offering. So the service of the house of the LORD was set in order.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-14-029-036" data-verse-ref="KJV.14.029.036"><span class="verse-number">36</span>And Hezekiah rejoiced, and all the people, that God had prepared the people: for the thing was done suddenly.</p>
