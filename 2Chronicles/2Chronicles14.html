            <p class="verse" id="v-14-014-001" data-verse-ref="KJV.14.014.001"><span class="verse-number">1</span>So Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead. In his days the land was quiet ten years.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-14-014-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.14.014.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>And Asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of the LORD his God:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-14-014-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.14.014.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>For he took away the altars of the strange gods, and the high places, and brake down the images, and cut down the groves:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-14-014-004" data-verse-ref="KJV.14.014.004"><span class="verse-number">4</span>And commanded Judah to seek the LORD God of their fathers, and to do the law and the commandment.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-14-014-005" data-verse-ref="KJV.14.014.005"><span class="verse-number">5</span>Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the images: and the kingdom was quiet before him.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-14-014-006" data-verse-ref="KJV.14.014.006"><span class="verse-number">6</span>And he built fenced cities in Judah: for the land had rest, and he had no war in those years; because the LORD had given him rest.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-14-014-007" data-verse-ref="KJV.14.014.007"><span class="verse-number">7</span>Therefore he said unto Judah, Let us build these cities, and make about them walls, and towers, gates, and bars, while the land is yet before us; because we have sought the LORD our God, we have sought him, and he hath given us rest on every side. So they built and prospered.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-14-014-008" data-verse-ref="KJV.14.014.008"><span class="verse-number">8</span>And Asa had an army of men that bare targets and spears, out of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bare shields and drew bows, two hundred and fourscore thousand: all these were mighty men of valour.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-14-014-009" data-verse-ref="KJV.14.014.009"><span class="verse-number">9</span>And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an host of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots; and came unto Mareshah.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-14-014-010" data-verse-ref="KJV.14.014.010"><span class="verse-number">10</span>Then Asa went out against him, and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-14-014-011" data-verse-ref="KJV.14.014.011"><span class="verse-number">11</span>And Asa cried unto the LORD his God, and said, LORD, it is nothing with thee to help, whether with many, or with them that have no power: help us, O LORD our God; for we rest on thee, and in thy name we go against this multitude. O LORD, thou art our God; let not man prevail against thee.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-14-014-012" data-verse-ref="KJV.14.014.012"><span class="verse-number">12</span>So the LORD smote the Ethiopians before Asa, and before Judah; and the Ethiopians fled.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-14-014-013" data-verse-ref="KJV.14.014.013"><span class="verse-number">13</span>And Asa and the people that were with him pursued them unto Gerar: and the Ethiopians were overthrown, that they could not recover themselves; for they were destroyed before the LORD, and before his host; and they carried away very much spoil.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-14-014-014" data-verse-ref="KJV.14.014.014"><span class="verse-number">14</span>And they smote all the cities round about Gerar; for the fear of the LORD came upon them: and they spoiled all the cities; for there was exceeding much spoil in them.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-14-014-015" data-verse-ref="KJV.14.014.015"><span class="verse-number">15</span>They smote also the tents of cattle, and carried away sheep and camels in abundance, and returned to Jerusalem.</p>
