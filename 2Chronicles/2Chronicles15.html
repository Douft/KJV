            <p class="verse" id="v-14-015-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.14.015.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>And he went out to meet Asa, and said unto him, Hear ye me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin; The LORD is with you, while ye be with him; and if ye seek him, he will be found of you; but if ye forsake him, he will forsake you.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-14-015-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.14.015.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>Now for a long season Israel hath been without the true God, and without a teaching priest, and without law.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-14-015-004" data-verse-ref="KJV.14.015.004"><span class="verse-number">4</span>But when they in their trouble did turn unto the LORD God of Israel, and sought him, he was found of them.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-14-015-005" data-verse-ref="KJV.14.015.005"><span class="verse-number">5</span>And in those times there was no peace to him that went out, nor to him that came in, but great vexations were upon all the inhabitants of the countries.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-14-015-006" data-verse-ref="KJV.14.015.006"><span class="verse-number">6</span>And nation was destroyed of nation, and city of city: for God did vex them with all adversity.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-14-015-007" data-verse-ref="KJV.14.015.007"><span class="verse-number">7</span>Be ye strong therefore, and let not your hands be weak: for your work shall be rewarded.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-14-015-009" data-verse-ref="KJV.14.015.009"><span class="verse-number">9</span>And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and the strangers with them out of Ephraim and Manasseh, and out of Simeon: for they fell to him out of Israel in abundance, when they saw that the LORD his God was with him.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-14-015-010" data-verse-ref="KJV.14.015.010"><span class="verse-number">10</span>So they gathered themselves together at Jerusalem in the third month, in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-14-015-015" data-verse-ref="KJV.14.015.015"><span class="verse-number">15</span>And all Judah rejoiced at the oath: for they had sworn with all their heart, and sought him with their whole desire; and he was found of them: and the LORD gave them rest round about.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-14-015-016" data-verse-ref="KJV.14.015.016"><span class="verse-number">16</span>And also concerning Maachah the mother of Asa the king, he removed her from being queen, because she had made an idol in a grove: and Asa cut down her idol, and stamped it, and burnt it at the brook Kidron.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-14-015-017" data-verse-ref="KJV.14.015.017"><span class="verse-number">17</span>But the high places were not taken away out of Israel: nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect all his days.</p>
