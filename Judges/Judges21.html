            <p class="verse" id="v-07-021-022" data-verse-ref="KJV.07.021.022"><span class="verse-number">22</span>And it shall be, when their fathers or their brethren come unto us to complain, that we will say unto them, Be favourable unto them for our sakes: because we reserved not to each man his wife in the war: for ye did not give unto them at this time, that ye should be guilty.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-07-021-023" data-verse-ref="KJV.07.021.023"><span class="verse-number">23</span>And the children of Benjamin did so, and took them wives, according to their number, of them that danced, whom they caught: and they went and returned unto their inheritance, and repaired the cities, and dwelt in them.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-07-021-024" data-verse-ref="KJV.07.021.024"><span class="verse-number">24</span>And the children of Israel departed thence at that time, every man to his tribe and to his family, and they went out from thence every man to his inheritance.</p>
