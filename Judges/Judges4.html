            <p class="verse" id="v-07-004-004" data-verse-ref="KJV.07.004.004"><span class="verse-number">4</span>And Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, she judged Israel at that time.</p>

So Barak went down from mount Tabor, and ten thousand men after him.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-07-004-015" data-verse-ref="KJV.07.004.015"><span class="verse-number">15</span>And the LORD discomfited Sisera, and all his chariots, and all his host, with the edge of the sword before Barak; so that Sisera lighted down off his chariot, and fled away on his feet.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-07-004-016" data-verse-ref="KJV.07.004.016"><span class="verse-number">16</span>But Barak pursued after the chariots, and after the host, unto Harosheth of the Gentiles: and all the host of Sisera fell upon the edge of the sword; and there was not a man left.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-07-004-017" data-verse-ref="KJV.07.004.017"><span class="verse-number">17</span>Howbeit Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite: for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-07-004-018" data-verse-ref="KJV.07.004.018"><span class="verse-number">18</span>And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said unto him, Turn in, my lord, turn in to me; fear not. And when he had turned in unto her into the tent, she covered him with a mantle.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-07-004-019" data-verse-ref="KJV.07.004.019"><span class="verse-number">19</span>And he said unto her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water to drink; for I am thirsty. And she opened a bottle of milk, and gave him drink, and covered him.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-07-004-020" data-verse-ref="KJV.07.004.020"><span class="verse-number">20</span>Again he said unto her, Stand in the door of the tent, and it shall be, when any man doth come and inquire of thee, and say, Is there any man here? that thou shalt say, No.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-07-004-021" data-verse-ref="KJV.07.004.021"><span class="verse-number">21</span>Then Jael Heber's wife took a nail of the tent, and took an hammer in her hand, and went softly unto him, and smote the nail into his temples, and fastened it into the ground: for he was fast asleep and weary. So he died.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-07-004-022" data-verse-ref="KJV.07.004.022"><span class="verse-number">22</span>And, behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him, and said unto him, Come, and I will shew thee the man whom thou seekest. And when he came into her tent, behold, Sisera lay dead, and the nail was in his temples.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-07-004-023" data-verse-ref="KJV.07.004.023"><span class="verse-number">23</span>So God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before the children of Israel.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-07-004-024" data-verse-ref="KJV.07.004.024"><span class="verse-number">24</span>And the hand of the children of Israel prospered, and prevailed against Jabin the king of Canaan, until they had destroyed Jabin king of Canaan.</p>
