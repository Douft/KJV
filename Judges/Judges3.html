            <p class="verse" id="v-07-003-008" data-verse-ref="KJV.07.003.008"><span class="verse-number">8</span>Therefore the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Chushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia: and the children of Israel served Chushanrishathaim eight years.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-07-003-009" data-verse-ref="KJV.07.003.009"><span class="verse-number">9</span>And when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD raised up a deliverer to the children of Israel, who delivered them, even Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-07-003-010" data-verse-ref="KJV.07.003.010"><span class="verse-number">10</span>And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he judged Israel, and went out to war: and the LORD delivered Chushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand; and his hand prevailed against Chushanrishathaim.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-07-003-012" data-verse-ref="KJV.07.003.012"><span class="verse-number">12</span>And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD: and the LORD strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done evil in the sight of the LORD.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-07-003-013" data-verse-ref="KJV.07.003.013"><span class="verse-number">13</span>And he gathered unto him the children of Ammon and Amalek, and went and smote Israel, and possessed the city of palm trees.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-07-003-014" data-verse-ref="KJV.07.003.014"><span class="verse-number">14</span>So the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-07-003-016" data-verse-ref="KJV.07.003.016"><span class="verse-number">16</span>But Ehud made him a dagger which had two edges, of a cubit length; and he did gird it under his raiment upon his right thigh.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-07-003-017" data-verse-ref="KJV.07.003.017"><span class="verse-number">17</span>And he brought the present unto Eglon king of Moab: and Eglon was a very fat man.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-07-003-018" data-verse-ref="KJV.07.003.018"><span class="verse-number">18</span>And when he had made an end to offer the present, he sent away the people that bare the present.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-07-003-019" data-verse-ref="KJV.07.003.019"><span class="verse-number">19</span>But he himself turned again from the quarries that were by Gilgal, and said, I have a secret errand unto thee, O king: who said, Keep silence. And all that stood by him went out from him.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-07-003-020" data-verse-ref="KJV.07.003.020"><span class="verse-number">20</span>And Ehud came unto him; and he was sitting in a summer parlour, which he had for himself alone. And Ehud said, I have a message from God unto thee. And he arose out of his seat.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-07-003-021" data-verse-ref="KJV.07.003.021"><span class="verse-number">21</span>And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the dagger from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-07-003-022" data-verse-ref="KJV.07.003.022"><span class="verse-number">22</span>And the haft also went in after the blade; and the fat closed upon the blade, so that he could not draw the dagger out of his belly; and the dirt came out.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-07-003-023" data-verse-ref="KJV.07.003.023"><span class="verse-number">23</span>Then Ehud went forth through the porch, and shut the doors of the parlour upon him, and locked them.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-07-003-024" data-verse-ref="KJV.07.003.024"><span class="verse-number">24</span>When he was gone out, his servants came; and when they saw that, behold, the doors of the parlour were locked, they said, Surely he covereth his feet in his summer chamber.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-07-003-025" data-verse-ref="KJV.07.003.025"><span class="verse-number">25</span>And they tarried till they were ashamed: and, behold, he opened not the doors of the parlour; therefore they took a key, and opened them: and, behold, their lord was fallen down dead on the earth.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-07-003-026" data-verse-ref="KJV.07.003.026"><span class="verse-number">26</span>And Ehud escaped while they tarried, and passed beyond the quarries, and escaped unto Seirath.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-07-003-027" data-verse-ref="KJV.07.003.027"><span class="verse-number">27</span>And it came to pass, when he was come, that he blew a trumpet in the mountain of Ephraim, and the children of Israel went down with him from the mount, and he before them.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-07-003-028" data-verse-ref="KJV.07.003.028"><span class="verse-number">28</span>And he said unto them, Follow after me: for the LORD hath delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand. And they went down after him, and took the fords of Jordan toward Moab, and suffered not a man to pass over.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-07-003-029" data-verse-ref="KJV.07.003.029"><span class="verse-number">29</span>And they slew of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, all lusty, and all men of valour; and there escaped not a man.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-07-003-030" data-verse-ref="KJV.07.003.030"><span class="verse-number">30</span>So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest fourscore years.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-07-003-031" data-verse-ref="KJV.07.003.031"><span class="verse-number">31</span>And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, which slew of the Philistines six hundred men with an ox goad: and he also delivered Israel.</p>
