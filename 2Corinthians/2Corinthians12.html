            <p class="verse" id="v-47-012-001" data-verse-ref="KJV.47.012.001"><span class="verse-number">1</span>It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory. I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-47-012-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.47.012.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;) such an one caught up to the third heaven.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-47-012-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.47.012.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>And I knew such a man, (whether in the body, or out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;)</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-47-012-004" data-verse-ref="KJV.47.012.004"><span class="verse-number">4</span>How that he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-47-012-005" data-verse-ref="KJV.47.012.005"><span class="verse-number">5</span>Of such an one will I glory: yet of myself I will not glory, but in mine infirmities.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-47-012-006" data-verse-ref="KJV.47.012.006"><span class="verse-number">6</span>For though I would desire to glory, I shall not be a fool; for I will say the truth: but now I forbear, lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth me to be, or that he heareth of me.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-47-012-007" data-verse-ref="KJV.47.012.007"><span class="verse-number">7</span>And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-47-012-008" data-verse-ref="KJV.47.012.008"><span class="verse-number">8</span>For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-47-012-009" data-verse-ref="KJV.47.012.009"><span class="verse-number">9</span>And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-47-012-010" data-verse-ref="KJV.47.012.010"><span class="verse-number">10</span>Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-47-012-011" data-verse-ref="KJV.47.012.011"><span class="verse-number">11</span>I am become a fool in glorying; ye have compelled me: for I ought to have been commended of you: for in nothing am I behind the very chiefest apostles, though I be nothing.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-47-012-012" data-verse-ref="KJV.47.012.012"><span class="verse-number">12</span>Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-47-012-013" data-verse-ref="KJV.47.012.013"><span class="verse-number">13</span>For what is it wherein ye were inferior to other churches, except it be that I myself was not burdensome to you? forgive me this wrong.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-47-012-014" data-verse-ref="KJV.47.012.014"><span class="verse-number">14</span>Behold, the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not be burdensome to you: for I seek not yours, but you: for the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-47-012-015" data-verse-ref="KJV.47.012.015"><span class="verse-number">15</span>And I will very gladly spend and be spent for you; though the more abundantly I love you, the less I be loved.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-47-012-016" data-verse-ref="KJV.47.012.016"><span class="verse-number">16</span>But be it so, I did not burden you: nevertheless, being crafty, I caught you with guile.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-47-012-017" data-verse-ref="KJV.47.012.017"><span class="verse-number">17</span>Did I make a gain of you by any of them whom I sent unto you?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-47-012-018" data-verse-ref="KJV.47.012.018"><span class="verse-number">18</span>I desired Titus, and with him I sent a brother. Did Titus make a gain of you? walked we not in the same spirit? walked we not in the same steps?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-47-012-019" data-verse-ref="KJV.47.012.019"><span class="verse-number">19</span>Again, think ye that we excuse ourselves unto you? we speak before God in Christ: but we do all things, dearly beloved, for your edifying.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-47-012-020" data-verse-ref="KJV.47.012.020"><span class="verse-number">20</span>For I fear, lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I would, and that I shall be found unto you such as ye would not: lest there be debates, envyings, wraths, strifes, backbitings, whisperings, swellings, tumults:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-47-012-021" data-verse-ref="KJV.47.012.021"><span class="verse-number">21</span>And lest, when I come again, my God will humble me among you, and that I shall bewail many which have sinned already, and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they have committed.</p>
