            <p class="verse" id="v-47-002-001" data-verse-ref="KJV.47.002.001"><span class="verse-number">1</span>But I determined this with myself, that I would not come again to you in heaviness.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-47-002-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.47.002.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>For if I make you sorry, who is he then that maketh me glad, but the same which is made sorry by me?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-47-002-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.47.002.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>And I wrote this same unto you, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy is the joy of you all.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-47-002-004" data-verse-ref="KJV.47.002.004"><span class="verse-number">4</span>For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears; not that ye should be grieved, but that ye might know the love which I have more abundantly unto you.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-47-002-005" data-verse-ref="KJV.47.002.005"><span class="verse-number">5</span>But if any have caused grief, he hath not grieved me, but in part: that I may not overcharge you all.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-47-002-006" data-verse-ref="KJV.47.002.006"><span class="verse-number">6</span>Sufficient to such a man is this punishment, which was inflicted of many.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-47-002-007" data-verse-ref="KJV.47.002.007"><span class="verse-number">7</span>So that contrariwise ye ought rather to forgive him, and comfort him, lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-47-002-008" data-verse-ref="KJV.47.002.008"><span class="verse-number">8</span>Wherefore I beseech you that ye would confirm your love toward him.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-47-002-009" data-verse-ref="KJV.47.002.009"><span class="verse-number">9</span>For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof of you, whether ye be obedient in all things.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-47-002-010" data-verse-ref="KJV.47.002.010"><span class="verse-number">10</span>To whom ye forgive any thing, I forgive also: for if I forgave any thing, to whom I forgave it, for your sakes forgave I it in the person of Christ;</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-47-002-011" data-verse-ref="KJV.47.002.011"><span class="verse-number">11</span>Lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his devices.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-47-002-012" data-verse-ref="KJV.47.002.012"><span class="verse-number">12</span>Furthermore, when I came to Troas to preach Christ's gospel, and a door was opened unto me of the Lord,</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-47-002-013" data-verse-ref="KJV.47.002.013"><span class="verse-number">13</span>I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother: but taking my leave of them, I went from thence into Macedonia.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-47-002-014" data-verse-ref="KJV.47.002.014"><span class="verse-number">14</span>Now thanks be unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-47-002-015" data-verse-ref="KJV.47.002.015"><span class="verse-number">15</span>For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ, in them that are saved, and in them that perish:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-47-002-016" data-verse-ref="KJV.47.002.016"><span class="verse-number">16</span>To the one we are the savour of death unto death; and to the other the savour of life unto life. And who is sufficient for these things?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-47-002-017" data-verse-ref="KJV.47.002.017"><span class="verse-number">17</span>For we are not as many, which corrupt the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ.</p>
