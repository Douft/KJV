            <p class="verse" id="v-47-001-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.47.001.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>Grace be to you and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-47-001-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.47.001.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort;</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-47-001-004" data-verse-ref="KJV.47.001.004"><span class="verse-number">4</span>Who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-47-001-005" data-verse-ref="KJV.47.001.005"><span class="verse-number">5</span>For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-47-001-006" data-verse-ref="KJV.47.001.006"><span class="verse-number">6</span>And whether we be afflicted, it is for your consolation and salvation, which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer: or whether we be comforted, it is for your consolation and salvation.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-47-001-007" data-verse-ref="KJV.47.001.007"><span class="verse-number">7</span>And our hope of you is stedfast, knowing, that as ye are partakers of the sufferings, so shall ye be also of the consolation.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-47-001-008" data-verse-ref="KJV.47.001.008"><span class="verse-number">8</span>For we would not, brethren, have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in Asia, that we were pressed out of measure, above strength, insomuch that we despaired even of life:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-47-001-009" data-verse-ref="KJV.47.001.009"><span class="verse-number">9</span>But we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God which raiseth the dead:</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-47-001-013" data-verse-ref="KJV.47.001.013"><span class="verse-number">13</span>For we write none other things unto you, than what ye read or acknowledge; and I trust ye shall acknowledge even to the end;</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-47-001-019" data-verse-ref="KJV.47.001.019"><span class="verse-number">19</span>For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, even by me and Silvanus and Timotheus, was not yea and nay, but in him was yea.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-47-001-020" data-verse-ref="KJV.47.001.020"><span class="verse-number">20</span>For all the promises of God in him are yea, and in him Amen, unto the glory of God by us.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-47-001-022" data-verse-ref="KJV.47.001.022"><span class="verse-number">22</span>Who hath also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-47-001-023" data-verse-ref="KJV.47.001.023"><span class="verse-number">23</span>Moreover I call God for a record upon my soul, that to spare you I came not as yet unto Corinth.</p>
