            <p class="verse" id="v-47-003-001" data-verse-ref="KJV.47.003.001"><span class="verse-number">1</span>Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some others, epistles of commendation to you, or letters of commendation from you?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-47-003-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.47.003.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>Ye are our epistle written in our hearts, known and read of all men:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-47-003-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.47.003.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>Forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-47-003-004" data-verse-ref="KJV.47.003.004"><span class="verse-number">4</span>And such trust have we through Christ to God-ward:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-47-003-005" data-verse-ref="KJV.47.003.005"><span class="verse-number">5</span>Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God;</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-47-003-006" data-verse-ref="KJV.47.003.006"><span class="verse-number">6</span>Who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-47-003-007" data-verse-ref="KJV.47.003.007"><span class="verse-number">7</span>But if the ministration of death, written and engraven in stones, was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which glory was to be done away:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-47-003-008" data-verse-ref="KJV.47.003.008"><span class="verse-number">8</span>How shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-47-003-009" data-verse-ref="KJV.47.003.009"><span class="verse-number">9</span>For if the ministration of condemnation be glory, much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-47-003-010" data-verse-ref="KJV.47.003.010"><span class="verse-number">10</span>For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect, by reason of the glory that excelleth.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-47-003-011" data-verse-ref="KJV.47.003.011"><span class="verse-number">11</span>For if that which is done away was glorious, much more that which remaineth is glorious.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-47-003-012" data-verse-ref="KJV.47.003.012"><span class="verse-number">12</span>Seeing then that we have such hope, we use great plainness of speech:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-47-003-013" data-verse-ref="KJV.47.003.013"><span class="verse-number">13</span>And not as Moses, which put a vail over his face, that the children of Israel could not stedfastly look to the end of that which is abolished:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-47-003-014" data-verse-ref="KJV.47.003.014"><span class="verse-number">14</span>But their minds were blinded: for until this day remaineth the same vail untaken away in the reading of the old testament; which vail is done away in Christ.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-47-003-015" data-verse-ref="KJV.47.003.015"><span class="verse-number">15</span>But even unto this day, when Moses is read, the vail is upon their heart.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-47-003-016" data-verse-ref="KJV.47.003.016"><span class="verse-number">16</span>Nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord, the vail shall be taken away.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-47-003-017" data-verse-ref="KJV.47.003.017"><span class="verse-number">17</span>Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-47-003-018" data-verse-ref="KJV.47.003.018"><span class="verse-number">18</span>But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.</p>
