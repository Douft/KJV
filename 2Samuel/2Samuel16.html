            <p class="verse" id="v-10-016-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.10.016.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>And the king said unto Ziba, What meanest thou by these? And Ziba said, The asses be for the king's household to ride on; and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat; and the wine, that such as be faint in the wilderness may drink.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-10-016-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.10.016.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>And the king said, And where is thy master's son? And Ziba said unto the king, Behold, he abideth at Jerusalem: for he said, To day shall the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-10-016-004" data-verse-ref="KJV.10.016.004"><span class="verse-number">4</span>Then said the king to Ziba, Behold, thine are all that pertained unto Mephibosheth. And Ziba said, I humbly beseech thee that I may find grace in thy sight, my lord, O king.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-10-016-005" data-verse-ref="KJV.10.016.005"><span class="verse-number">5</span>And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, thence came out a man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera: he came forth, and cursed still as he came.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-10-016-006" data-verse-ref="KJV.10.016.006"><span class="verse-number">6</span>And he cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David: and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-10-016-007" data-verse-ref="KJV.10.016.007"><span class="verse-number">7</span>And thus said Shimei when he cursed, Come out, come out, thou bloody man, and thou man of Belial:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-10-016-008" data-verse-ref="KJV.10.016.008"><span class="verse-number">8</span>The LORD hath returned upon thee all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose stead thou hast reigned; and the LORD hath delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son: and, behold, thou art taken in thy mischief, because thou art a bloody man.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-10-016-009" data-verse-ref="KJV.10.016.009"><span class="verse-number">9</span>Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah unto the king, Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? let me go over, I pray thee, and take off his head.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-10-016-010" data-verse-ref="KJV.10.016.010"><span class="verse-number">10</span>And the king said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah? so let him curse, because the LORD hath said unto him, Curse David. Who shall then say, Wherefore hast thou done so?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-10-016-011" data-verse-ref="KJV.10.016.011"><span class="verse-number">11</span>And David said to Abishai, and to all his servants, Behold, my son, which came forth of my bowels, seeketh my life: how much more now may this Benjamite do it? let him alone, and let him curse; for the LORD hath bidden him.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-10-016-012" data-verse-ref="KJV.10.016.012"><span class="verse-number">12</span>It may be that the LORD will look on mine affliction, and that the LORD will requite me good for his cursing this day.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-10-016-014" data-verse-ref="KJV.10.016.014"><span class="verse-number">14</span>And the king, and all the people that were with him, came weary, and refreshed themselves there.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-10-016-015" data-verse-ref="KJV.10.016.015"><span class="verse-number">15</span>And Absalom, and all the people the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-10-016-016" data-verse-ref="KJV.10.016.016"><span class="verse-number">16</span>And it came to pass, when Hushai the Archite, David's friend, was come unto Absalom, that Hushai said unto Absalom, God save the king, God save the king.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-10-016-017" data-verse-ref="KJV.10.016.017"><span class="verse-number">17</span>And Absalom said to Hushai, Is this thy kindness to thy friend? why wentest thou not with thy friend?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-10-016-018" data-verse-ref="KJV.10.016.018"><span class="verse-number">18</span>And Hushai said unto Absalom, Nay; but whom the LORD, and this people, and all the men of Israel, choose, his will I be, and with him will I abide.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-10-016-019" data-verse-ref="KJV.10.016.019"><span class="verse-number">19</span>And again, whom should I serve? should I not serve in the presence of his son? as I have served in thy father's presence, so will I be in thy presence.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-10-016-020" data-verse-ref="KJV.10.016.020"><span class="verse-number">20</span>Then said Absalom to Ahithophel, Give counsel among you what we shall do.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-10-016-021" data-verse-ref="KJV.10.016.021"><span class="verse-number">21</span>And Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Go in unto thy father's concubines, which he hath left to keep the house; and all Israel shall hear that thou art abhorred of thy father: then shall the hands of all that are with thee be strong.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-10-016-022" data-verse-ref="KJV.10.016.022"><span class="verse-number">22</span>So they spread Absalom a tent upon the top of the house; and Absalom went in unto his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-10-016-023" data-verse-ref="KJV.10.016.023"><span class="verse-number">23</span>And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counselled in those days, was as if a man had inquired at the oracle of God: so was all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom.</p>
