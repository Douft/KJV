            <p class="verse" id="v-15-001-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.15.001.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, The LORD God of heaven hath given me all the kingdoms of the earth; and he hath charged me to build him an house at Jerusalem, which is in Judah.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-15-001-004" data-verse-ref="KJV.15.001.004"><span class="verse-number">4</span>And whosoever remaineth in any place where he sojourneth, let the men of his place help him with silver, and with gold, and with goods, and with beasts, beside the freewill offering for the house of God that is in Jerusalem.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-15-001-005" data-verse-ref="KJV.15.001.005"><span class="verse-number">5</span>Then rose up the chief of the fathers of Judah and Benjamin, and the priests, and the Levites, with all them whose spirit God had raised, to go up to build the house of the LORD which is in Jerusalem.</p>
