            <p class="verse" id="v-48-001-001" data-verse-ref="KJV.48.001.001"><span class="verse-number">1</span>Paul, an apostle, (not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead;)</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-48-001-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.48.001.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>And all the brethren which are with me, unto the churches of Galatia:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-48-001-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.48.001.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>Grace be to you and peace from God the Father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ,</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-48-001-004" data-verse-ref="KJV.48.001.004"><span class="verse-number">4</span>Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of God and our Father:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-48-001-005" data-verse-ref="KJV.48.001.005"><span class="verse-number">5</span>To whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-48-001-006" data-verse-ref="KJV.48.001.006"><span class="verse-number">6</span>I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-48-001-007" data-verse-ref="KJV.48.001.007"><span class="verse-number">7</span>Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-48-001-008" data-verse-ref="KJV.48.001.008"><span class="verse-number">8</span>But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-48-001-009" data-verse-ref="KJV.48.001.009"><span class="verse-number">9</span>As we said before, so say I now again, If any man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-48-001-010" data-verse-ref="KJV.48.001.010"><span class="verse-number">10</span>For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-48-001-011" data-verse-ref="KJV.48.001.011"><span class="verse-number">11</span>But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-48-001-012" data-verse-ref="KJV.48.001.012"><span class="verse-number">12</span>For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-48-001-013" data-verse-ref="KJV.48.001.013"><span class="verse-number">13</span>For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews' religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-48-001-014" data-verse-ref="KJV.48.001.014"><span class="verse-number">14</span>And profited in the Jews' religion above many my equals in mine own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-48-001-015" data-verse-ref="KJV.48.001.015"><span class="verse-number">15</span>But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's womb, and called me by his grace,</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-48-001-016" data-verse-ref="KJV.48.001.016"><span class="verse-number">16</span>To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-48-001-017" data-verse-ref="KJV.48.001.017"><span class="verse-number">17</span>Neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were apostles before me; but I went into Arabia, and returned again unto Damascus.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-48-001-018" data-verse-ref="KJV.48.001.018"><span class="verse-number">18</span>Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and abode with him fifteen days.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-48-001-019" data-verse-ref="KJV.48.001.019"><span class="verse-number">19</span>But other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord's brother.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-48-001-020" data-verse-ref="KJV.48.001.020"><span class="verse-number">20</span>Now the things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie not.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-48-001-021" data-verse-ref="KJV.48.001.021"><span class="verse-number">21</span>Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia;</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-48-001-022" data-verse-ref="KJV.48.001.022"><span class="verse-number">22</span>And was unknown by face unto the churches of Judaea which were in Christ:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-48-001-023" data-verse-ref="KJV.48.001.023"><span class="verse-number">23</span>But they had heard only, That he which persecuted us in times past now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-48-001-024" data-verse-ref="KJV.48.001.024"><span class="verse-number">24</span>And they glorified God in me.</p>
