            <p class="verse" id="v-61-001-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.61.001.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord,</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-61-001-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.61.001.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-61-001-004" data-verse-ref="KJV.61.001.004"><span class="verse-number">4</span>Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-61-001-005" data-verse-ref="KJV.61.001.005"><span class="verse-number">5</span>And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge;</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-61-001-006" data-verse-ref="KJV.61.001.006"><span class="verse-number">6</span>And to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness;</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-61-001-007" data-verse-ref="KJV.61.001.007"><span class="verse-number">7</span>And to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-61-001-008" data-verse-ref="KJV.61.001.008"><span class="verse-number">8</span>For if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-61-001-009" data-verse-ref="KJV.61.001.009"><span class="verse-number">9</span>But he that lacketh these things is blind, and cannot see afar off, and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-61-001-010" data-verse-ref="KJV.61.001.010"><span class="verse-number">10</span>Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall never fall:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-61-001-011" data-verse-ref="KJV.61.001.011"><span class="verse-number">11</span>For so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-61-001-012" data-verse-ref="KJV.61.001.012"><span class="verse-number">12</span>Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things, though ye know them, and be established in the present truth.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-61-001-013" data-verse-ref="KJV.61.001.013"><span class="verse-number">13</span>Yea, I think it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting you in remembrance;</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-61-001-014" data-verse-ref="KJV.61.001.014"><span class="verse-number">14</span>Knowing that shortly I must put off this my tabernacle, even as our Lord Jesus Christ hath shewed me.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-61-001-015" data-verse-ref="KJV.61.001.015"><span class="verse-number">15</span>Moreover I will endeavour that ye may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-61-001-016" data-verse-ref="KJV.61.001.016"><span class="verse-number">16</span>For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-61-001-017" data-verse-ref="KJV.61.001.017"><span class="verse-number">17</span>For he received from God the Father honour and glory, when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-61-001-018" data-verse-ref="KJV.61.001.018"><span class="verse-number">18</span>And this voice which came from heaven we heard, when we were with him in the holy mount.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-61-001-019" data-verse-ref="KJV.61.001.019"><span class="verse-number">19</span>We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-61-001-020" data-verse-ref="KJV.61.001.020"><span class="verse-number">20</span>Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-61-001-021" data-verse-ref="KJV.61.001.021"><span class="verse-number">21</span>For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.</p>
