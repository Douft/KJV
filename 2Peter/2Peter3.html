            <p class="verse" id="v-61-003-001" data-verse-ref="KJV.61.003.001"><span class="verse-number">1</span>This second epistle, beloved, I now write unto you; in both which I stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-61-003-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.61.003.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>That ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and of the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord and Saviour:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-61-003-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.61.003.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts,</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-61-003-004" data-verse-ref="KJV.61.003.004"><span class="verse-number">4</span>And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-61-003-005" data-verse-ref="KJV.61.003.005"><span class="verse-number">5</span>For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the water:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-61-003-006" data-verse-ref="KJV.61.003.006"><span class="verse-number">6</span>Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-61-003-007" data-verse-ref="KJV.61.003.007"><span class="verse-number">7</span>But the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-61-003-008" data-verse-ref="KJV.61.003.008"><span class="verse-number">8</span>But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-61-003-009" data-verse-ref="KJV.61.003.009"><span class="verse-number">9</span>The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-61-003-010" data-verse-ref="KJV.61.003.010"><span class="verse-number">10</span>But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-61-003-011" data-verse-ref="KJV.61.003.011"><span class="verse-number">11</span>Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness,</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-61-003-012" data-verse-ref="KJV.61.003.012"><span class="verse-number">12</span>Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-61-003-013" data-verse-ref="KJV.61.003.013"><span class="verse-number">13</span>Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-61-003-014" data-verse-ref="KJV.61.003.014"><span class="verse-number">14</span>Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot, and blameless.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-61-003-015" data-verse-ref="KJV.61.003.015"><span class="verse-number">15</span>And account that the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation; even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you;</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-61-003-016" data-verse-ref="KJV.61.003.016"><span class="verse-number">16</span>As also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things; in which are some things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also the other scriptures, unto their own destruction.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-61-003-017" data-verse-ref="KJV.61.003.017"><span class="verse-number">17</span>Ye therefore, beloved, seeing ye know these things before, beware lest ye also, being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own stedfastness.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-61-003-018" data-verse-ref="KJV.61.003.018"><span class="verse-number">18</span>But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and for ever. Amen.</p>
