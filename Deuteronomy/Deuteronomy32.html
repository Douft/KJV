            <p class="verse" id="v-05-032-036" data-verse-ref="KJV.05.032.036"><span class="verse-number">36</span>For the LORD shall judge his people, and repent himself for his servants, when he seeth that their power is gone, and there is none shut up, or left.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-05-032-051" data-verse-ref="KJV.05.032.051"><span class="verse-number">51</span>Because ye trespassed against me among the children of Israel at the waters of MeribahKadesh, in the wilderness of Zin; because ye sanctified me not in the midst of the children of Israel.</p>
