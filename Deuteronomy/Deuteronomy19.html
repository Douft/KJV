            <p class="verse" id="v-05-019-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.05.019.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>Thou shalt separate three cities for thee in the midst of thy land, which the LORD thy God giveth thee to possess it.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-05-019-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.05.019.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>Thou shalt prepare thee a way, and divide the coasts of thy land, which the LORD thy God giveth thee to inherit, into three parts, that every slayer may flee thither.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-05-019-004" data-verse-ref="KJV.05.019.004"><span class="verse-number">4</span>And this is the case of the slayer, which shall flee thither, that he may live: Whoso killeth his neighbour ignorantly, whom he hated not in time past;</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-05-019-005" data-verse-ref="KJV.05.019.005"><span class="verse-number">5</span>As when a man goeth into the wood with his neighbour to hew wood, and his hand fetcheth a stroke with the axe to cut down the tree, and the head slippeth from the helve, and lighteth upon his neighbour, that he die; he shall flee unto one of those cities, and live:</p>
