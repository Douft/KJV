            <p class="verse" id="v-05-001-038" data-verse-ref="KJV.05.001.038"><span class="verse-number">38</span>But Joshua the son of Nun, which standeth before thee, he shall go in thither: encourage him: for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-05-001-039" data-verse-ref="KJV.05.001.039"><span class="verse-number">39</span>Moreover your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, and your children, which in that day had no knowledge between good and evil, they shall go in thither, and unto them will I give it, and they shall possess it.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-05-001-040" data-verse-ref="KJV.05.001.040"><span class="verse-number">40</span>But as for you, turn you, and take your journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-05-001-042" data-verse-ref="KJV.05.001.042"><span class="verse-number">42</span>And the LORD said unto me, Say unto them, Go not up, neither fight; for I am not among you; lest ye be smitten before your enemies.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-05-001-043" data-verse-ref="KJV.05.001.043"><span class="verse-number">43</span>So I spake unto you; and ye would not hear, but rebelled against the commandment of the LORD, and went presumptuously up into the hill.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-05-001-044" data-verse-ref="KJV.05.001.044"><span class="verse-number">44</span>And the Amorites, which dwelt in that mountain, came out against you, and chased you, as bees do, and destroyed you in Seir, even unto Hormah.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-05-001-045" data-verse-ref="KJV.05.001.045"><span class="verse-number">45</span>And ye returned and wept before the LORD; but the LORD would not hearken to your voice, nor give ear unto you.</p>
