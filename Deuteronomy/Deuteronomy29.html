            <p class="verse" id="v-05-029-024" data-verse-ref="KJV.05.029.024"><span class="verse-number">24</span>Even all nations shall say, Wherefore hath the LORD done thus unto this land? what meaneth the heat of this great anger?</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-05-029-026" data-verse-ref="KJV.05.029.026"><span class="verse-number">26</span>For they went and served other gods, and worshipped them, gods whom they knew not, and whom he had not given unto them:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-05-029-027" data-verse-ref="KJV.05.029.027"><span class="verse-number">27</span>And the anger of the LORD was kindled against this land, to bring upon it all the curses that are written in this book:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-05-029-028" data-verse-ref="KJV.05.029.028"><span class="verse-number">28</span>And the LORD rooted them out of their land in anger, and in wrath, and in great indignation, and cast them into another land, as it is this day.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-05-029-029" data-verse-ref="KJV.05.029.029"><span class="verse-number">29</span>The secret things belong unto the LORD our God: but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children for ever, that we may do all the words of this law.</p>
