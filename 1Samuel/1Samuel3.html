            <p class="verse" id="v-09-003-001" data-verse-ref="KJV.09.003.001"><span class="verse-number">1</span>And the child Samuel ministered unto the LORD before Eli. And the word of the LORD was precious in those days; there was no open vision.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-09-003-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.09.003.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>And it came to pass at that time, when Eli was laid down in his place, and his eyes began to wax dim, that he could not see;</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-09-003-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.09.003.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>And ere the lamp of God went out in the temple of the LORD, where the ark of God was, and Samuel was laid down to sleep;</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-09-003-004" data-verse-ref="KJV.09.003.004"><span class="verse-number">4</span>That the LORD called Samuel: and he answered, Here am I.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-09-003-005" data-verse-ref="KJV.09.003.005"><span class="verse-number">5</span>And he ran unto Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And he said, I called not; lie down again. And he went and lay down.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-09-003-006" data-verse-ref="KJV.09.003.006"><span class="verse-number">6</span>And the LORD called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And he answered, I called not, my son; lie down again.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-09-003-007" data-verse-ref="KJV.09.003.007"><span class="verse-number">7</span>Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, neither was the word of the LORD yet revealed unto him.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-09-003-008" data-verse-ref="KJV.09.003.008"><span class="verse-number">8</span>And the LORD called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And Eli perceived that the LORD had called the child.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-09-003-009" data-verse-ref="KJV.09.003.009"><span class="verse-number">9</span>Therefore Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, LORD; for thy servant heareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his place.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-09-003-010" data-verse-ref="KJV.09.003.010"><span class="verse-number">10</span>And the LORD came, and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel answered, Speak; for thy servant heareth.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-09-003-011" data-verse-ref="KJV.09.003.011"><span class="verse-number">11</span>And the LORD said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-09-003-012" data-verse-ref="KJV.09.003.012"><span class="verse-number">12</span>In that day I will perform against Eli all things which I have spoken concerning his house: when I begin, I will also make an end.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-09-003-013" data-verse-ref="KJV.09.003.013"><span class="verse-number">13</span>For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever for the iniquity which he knoweth; because his sons made themselves vile, and he restrained them not.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-09-003-014" data-verse-ref="KJV.09.003.014"><span class="verse-number">14</span>And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering for ever.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-09-003-015" data-verse-ref="KJV.09.003.015"><span class="verse-number">15</span>And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of the LORD. And Samuel feared to shew Eli the vision.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-09-003-016" data-verse-ref="KJV.09.003.016"><span class="verse-number">16</span>Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he answered, Here am I.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-09-003-017" data-verse-ref="KJV.09.003.017"><span class="verse-number">17</span>And he said, What is the thing that the LORD hath said unto thee? I pray thee hide it not from me: God do so to thee, and more also, if thou hide any thing from me of all the things that he said unto thee.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-09-003-018" data-verse-ref="KJV.09.003.018"><span class="verse-number">18</span>And Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him. And he said, It is the LORD: let him do what seemeth him good.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-09-003-019" data-verse-ref="KJV.09.003.019"><span class="verse-number">19</span>And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-09-003-020" data-verse-ref="KJV.09.003.020"><span class="verse-number">20</span>And all Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of the LORD.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-09-003-021" data-verse-ref="KJV.09.003.021"><span class="verse-number">21</span>And the LORD appeared again in Shiloh: for the LORD revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the LORD.</p>
