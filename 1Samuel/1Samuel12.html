            <p class="verse" id="v-09-012-015" data-verse-ref="KJV.09.012.015"><span class="verse-number">15</span>But if ye will not obey the voice of the LORD, but rebel against the commandment of the LORD, then shall the hand of the LORD be against you, as it was against your fathers.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-09-012-016" data-verse-ref="KJV.09.012.016"><span class="verse-number">16</span>Now therefore stand and see this great thing, which the LORD will do before your eyes.</p>

I will call unto the LORD, and he shall send thunder and rain; that ye may perceive and see that your wickedness is great, which ye have done in the sight of the LORD, in asking you a king.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-09-012-018" data-verse-ref="KJV.09.012.018"><span class="verse-number">18</span>So Samuel called unto the LORD; and the LORD sent thunder and rain that day: and all the people greatly feared the LORD and Samuel.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-09-012-019" data-verse-ref="KJV.09.012.019"><span class="verse-number">19</span>And all the people said unto Samuel, Pray for thy servants unto the LORD thy God, that we die not: for we have added unto all our sins this evil, to ask us a king.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-09-012-020" data-verse-ref="KJV.09.012.020"><span class="verse-number">20</span>And Samuel said unto the people, Fear not: ye have done all this wickedness: yet turn not aside from following the LORD, but serve the LORD with all your heart;</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-09-012-021" data-verse-ref="KJV.09.012.021"><span class="verse-number">21</span>And turn ye not aside: for then should ye go after vain things, which cannot profit nor deliver; for they are vain.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-09-012-022" data-verse-ref="KJV.09.012.022"><span class="verse-number">22</span>For the LORD will not forsake his people for his great name's sake: because it hath pleased the LORD to make you his people.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-09-012-023" data-verse-ref="KJV.09.012.023"><span class="verse-number">23</span>Moreover as for me, God forbid that I should sin against the LORD in ceasing to pray for you: but I will teach you the good and the right way:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-09-012-024" data-verse-ref="KJV.09.012.024"><span class="verse-number">24</span>Only fear the LORD, and serve him in truth with all your heart: for consider how great things he hath done for you.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-09-012-025" data-verse-ref="KJV.09.012.025"><span class="verse-number">25</span>But if ye shall still do wickedly, ye shall be consumed, both ye and your king.</p>
