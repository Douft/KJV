            <p class="verse" id="v-09-022-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.09.022.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>And every one that was in distress, and every one that was in debt, and every one that was discontented, gathered themselves unto him; and he became a captain over them: and there were with him about four hundred men.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-09-022-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.09.022.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>And David went thence to Mizpeh of Moab: and he said unto the king of Moab, Let my father and my mother, I pray thee, come forth, and be with you, till I know what God will do for me.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-09-022-004" data-verse-ref="KJV.09.022.004"><span class="verse-number">4</span>And he brought them before the king of Moab: and they dwelt with him all the while that David was in the hold.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-09-022-007" data-verse-ref="KJV.09.022.007"><span class="verse-number">7</span>Then Saul said unto his servants that stood about him, Hear now, ye Benjamites; will the son of Jesse give every one of you fields and vineyards, and make you all captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds;</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-09-022-008" data-verse-ref="KJV.09.022.008"><span class="verse-number">8</span>That all of you have conspired against me, and there is none that sheweth me that my son hath made a league with the son of Jesse, and there is none of you that is sorry for me, or sheweth unto me that my son hath stirred up my servant against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-09-022-009" data-verse-ref="KJV.09.022.009"><span class="verse-number">9</span>Then answered Doeg the Edomite, which was set over the servants of Saul, and said, I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-09-022-015" data-verse-ref="KJV.09.022.015"><span class="verse-number">15</span>Did I then begin to inquire of God for him? be it far from me: let not the king impute any thing unto his servant, nor to all the house of my father: for thy servant knew nothing of all this, less or more.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-09-022-016" data-verse-ref="KJV.09.022.016"><span class="verse-number">16</span>And the king said, Thou shalt surely die, Ahimelech, thou, and all thy father's house.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-09-022-017" data-verse-ref="KJV.09.022.017"><span class="verse-number">17</span>And the king said unto the footmen that stood about him, Turn, and slay the priests of the LORD; because their hand also is with David, and because they knew when he fled, and did not shew it to me. But the servants of the king would not put forth their hand to fall upon the priests of the LORD.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-09-022-018" data-verse-ref="KJV.09.022.018"><span class="verse-number">18</span>And the king said to Doeg, Turn thou, and fall upon the priests.

            <p class="verse" id="v-09-022-019" data-verse-ref="KJV.09.022.019"><span class="verse-number">19</span>And Nob, the city of the priests, smote he with the edge of the sword, both men and women, children and sucklings, and oxen, and asses, and sheep, with the edge of the sword.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-09-022-020" data-verse-ref="KJV.09.022.020"><span class="verse-number">20</span>And one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped, and fled after David.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-09-022-021" data-verse-ref="KJV.09.022.021"><span class="verse-number">21</span>And Abiathar shewed David that Saul had slain the LORD'S priests.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-09-022-022" data-verse-ref="KJV.09.022.022"><span class="verse-number">22</span>And David said unto Abiathar, I knew it that day, when Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would surely tell Saul: I have occasioned the death of all the persons of thy father's house.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-09-022-023" data-verse-ref="KJV.09.022.023"><span class="verse-number">23</span>Abide thou with me, fear not: for he that seeketh my life seeketh thy life: but with me thou shalt be in safeguard.</p>
