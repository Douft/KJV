            <p class="verse" id="v-44-003-005" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.003.005"><span class="verse-number">5</span>And he gave heed unto them, expecting to receive something of them.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-003-006" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.003.006"><span class="verse-number">6</span>Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-003-007" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.003.007"><span class="verse-number">7</span>And he took him by the right hand, and lifted him up: and immediately his feet and ancle bones received strength.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-44-003-022" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.003.022"><span class="verse-number">22</span>For Moses truly said unto the fathers, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-003-023" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.003.023"><span class="verse-number">23</span>And it shall come to pass, that every soul, which will not hear that prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people.</p>
