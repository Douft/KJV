            <p class="verse" id="v-44-007-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.007.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>And he said, Men, brethren, and fathers, hearken; The God of glory appeared unto our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Charran,</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-007-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.007.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>And said unto him, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and come into the land which I shall shew thee.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-007-004" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.007.004"><span class="verse-number">4</span>Then came he out of the land of the Chaldaeans, and dwelt in Charran: and from thence, when his father was dead, he removed him into this land, wherein ye now dwell.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-007-005" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.007.005"><span class="verse-number">5</span>And he gave him none inheritance in it, no, not so much as to set his foot on: yet he promised that he would give it to him for a possession, and to his seed after him, when as yet he had no child.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-007-006" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.007.006"><span class="verse-number">6</span>And God spake on this wise, That his seed should sojourn in a strange land; and that they should bring them into bondage, and entreat them evil four hundred years.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-44-007-009" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.007.009"><span class="verse-number">9</span>And the patriarchs, moved with envy, sold Joseph into Egypt: but God was with him,</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-44-007-017" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.007.017"><span class="verse-number">17</span>But when the time of the promise drew nigh, which God had sworn to Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt,</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-44-007-021" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.007.021"><span class="verse-number">21</span>And when he was cast out, Pharaoh's daughter took him up, and nourished him for her own son.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-007-022" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.007.022"><span class="verse-number">22</span>And Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was mighty in words and in deeds.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-007-023" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.007.023"><span class="verse-number">23</span>And when he was full forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brethren the children of Israel.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-007-024" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.007.024"><span class="verse-number">24</span>And seeing one of them suffer wrong, he defended him, and avenged him that was oppressed, and smote the Egyptian:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-007-025" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.007.025"><span class="verse-number">25</span>For he supposed his brethren would have understood how that God by his hand would deliver them: but they understood not.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-007-026" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.007.026"><span class="verse-number">26</span>And the next day he shewed himself unto them as they strove, and would have set them at one again, saying, Sirs, ye are brethren; why do ye wrong one to another?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-007-027" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.007.027"><span class="verse-number">27</span>But he that did his neighbour wrong thrust him away, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge over us?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-007-028" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.007.028"><span class="verse-number">28</span>Wilt thou kill me, as thou diddest the Egyptian yesterday?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-007-029" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.007.029"><span class="verse-number">29</span>Then fled Moses at this saying, and was a stranger in the land of Madian, where he begat two sons.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-007-030" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.007.030"><span class="verse-number">30</span>And when forty years were expired, there appeared to him in the wilderness of mount Sina an angel of the Lord in a flame of fire in a bush.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-007-031" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.007.031"><span class="verse-number">31</span>When Moses saw it, he wondered at the sight: and as he drew near to behold it, the voice of the Lord came unto him,</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-007-032" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.007.032"><span class="verse-number">32</span>Saying, I am the God of thy fathers, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. Then Moses trembled, and durst not behold.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-007-033" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.007.033"><span class="verse-number">33</span>Then said the Lord to him, Put off thy shoes from thy feet: for the place where thou standest is holy ground.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-007-034" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.007.034"><span class="verse-number">34</span>I have seen, I have seen the affliction of my people which is in Egypt, and I have heard their groaning, and am come down to deliver them. And now come, I will send thee into Egypt.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-007-035" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.007.035"><span class="verse-number">35</span>This Moses whom they refused, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge? the same did God send to be a ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the angel which appeared to him in the bush.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-44-007-037" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.007.037"><span class="verse-number">37</span>This is that Moses, which said unto the children of Israel, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-007-038" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.007.038"><span class="verse-number">38</span>This is he, that was in the church in the wilderness with the angel which spake to him in the mount Sina, and with our fathers: who received the lively oracles to give unto us:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-007-039" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.007.039"><span class="verse-number">39</span>To whom our fathers would not obey, but thrust him from them, and in their hearts turned back again into Egypt,</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-007-040" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.007.040"><span class="verse-number">40</span>Saying unto Aaron, Make us gods to go before us: for as for this Moses, which brought us out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-007-041" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.007.041"><span class="verse-number">41</span>And they made a calf in those days, and offered sacrifice unto the idol, and rejoiced in the works of their own hands.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-007-042" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.007.042"><span class="verse-number">42</span>Then God turned, and gave them up to worship the host of heaven; as it is written in the book of the prophets, O ye house of Israel, have ye offered to me slain beasts and sacrifices by the space of forty years in the wilderness?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-007-043" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.007.043"><span class="verse-number">43</span>Yea, ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your god Remphan, figures which ye made to worship them: and I will carry you away beyond Babylon.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-44-007-053" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.007.053"><span class="verse-number">53</span>Who have received the law by the disposition of angels, and have not kept it.</p>
