            <p class="verse" id="v-44-008-001" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.008.001"><span class="verse-number">1</span>And Saul was consenting unto his death. And at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judaea and Samaria, except the apostles.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-008-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.008.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>And devout men carried Stephen to his burial, and made great lamentation over him.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-008-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.008.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>As for Saul, he made havock of the church, entering into every house, and haling men and women committed them to prison.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-008-004" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.008.004"><span class="verse-number">4</span>Therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where preaching the word.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-008-005" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.008.005"><span class="verse-number">5</span>Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached Christ unto them.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-008-006" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.008.006"><span class="verse-number">6</span>And the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which Philip spake, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-008-007" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.008.007"><span class="verse-number">7</span>For unclean spirits, crying with loud voice, came out of many that were possessed with them: and many taken with palsies, and that were lame, were healed.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-008-008" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.008.008"><span class="verse-number">8</span>And there was great joy in that city.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-008-009" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.008.009"><span class="verse-number">9</span>But there was a certain man, called Simon, which beforetime in the same city used sorcery, and bewitched the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-008-010" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.008.010"><span class="verse-number">10</span>To whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great power of God.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-008-011" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.008.011"><span class="verse-number">11</span>And to him they had regard, because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-008-012" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.008.012"><span class="verse-number">12</span>But when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-008-013" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.008.013"><span class="verse-number">13</span>Then Simon himself believed also: and when he was baptized, he continued with Philip, and wondered, beholding the miracles and signs which were done.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-008-014" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.008.014"><span class="verse-number">14</span>Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-008-015" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.008.015"><span class="verse-number">15</span>Who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-008-016" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.008.016"><span class="verse-number">16</span>(For as yet he was fallen upon none of them: only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.)</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-008-017" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.008.017"><span class="verse-number">17</span>Then laid they their hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-008-018" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.008.018"><span class="verse-number">18</span>And when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles' hands the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money,</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-008-019" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.008.019"><span class="verse-number">19</span>Saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-008-020" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.008.020"><span class="verse-number">20</span>But Peter said unto him, Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-008-021" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.008.021"><span class="verse-number">21</span>Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is not right in the sight of God.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-008-022" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.008.022"><span class="verse-number">22</span>Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-008-023" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.008.023"><span class="verse-number">23</span>For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and in the bond of iniquity.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-008-024" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.008.024"><span class="verse-number">24</span>Then answered Simon, and said, Pray ye to the Lord for me, that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-008-025" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.008.025"><span class="verse-number">25</span>And they, when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-008-026" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.008.026"><span class="verse-number">26</span>And the angel of the Lord spake unto Philip, saying, Arise, and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza, which is desert.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-008-027" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.008.027"><span class="verse-number">27</span>And he arose and went: and, behold, a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who had the charge of all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem for to worship,</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-008-028" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.008.028"><span class="verse-number">28</span>Was returning, and sitting in his chariot read Esaias the prophet.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-008-029" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.008.029"><span class="verse-number">29</span>Then the Spirit said unto Philip, Go near, and join thyself to this chariot.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-008-030" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.008.030"><span class="verse-number">30</span>And Philip ran thither to him, and heard him read the prophet Esaias, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-008-031" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.008.031"><span class="verse-number">31</span>And he said, How can I, except some man should guide me? And he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-008-032" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.008.032"><span class="verse-number">32</span>The place of the scripture which he read was this, He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so opened he not his mouth:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-008-033" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.008.033"><span class="verse-number">33</span>In his humiliation his judgment was taken away: and who shall declare his generation? for his life is taken from the earth.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-008-034" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.008.034"><span class="verse-number">34</span>And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom speaketh the prophet this? of himself, or of some other man?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-008-035" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.008.035"><span class="verse-number">35</span>Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same scripture, and preached unto him Jesus.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-008-036" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.008.036"><span class="verse-number">36</span>And as they went on their way, they came unto a certain water: and the eunuch said, See, here is water; what doth hinder me to be baptized?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-008-037" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.008.037"><span class="verse-number">37</span>And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-008-038" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.008.038"><span class="verse-number">38</span>And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went down both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-008-039" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.008.039"><span class="verse-number">39</span>And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more: and he went on his way rejoicing.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-008-040" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.008.040"><span class="verse-number">40</span>But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he preached in all the cities, till he came to Caesarea.</p>
