            <p class="verse" id="v-44-006-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.006.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>Then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples unto them, and said, It is not reason that we should leave the word of God, and serve tables.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-006-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.006.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>Wherefore, brethren, look ye out among you seven men of honest report, full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-006-004" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.006.004"><span class="verse-number">4</span>But we will give ourselves continually to prayer, and to the ministry of the word.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-006-005" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.006.005"><span class="verse-number">5</span>And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-006-006" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.006.006"><span class="verse-number">6</span>Whom they set before the apostles: and when they had prayed, they laid their hands on them.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-006-007" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.006.007"><span class="verse-number">7</span>And the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem greatly; and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-006-008" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.006.008"><span class="verse-number">8</span>And Stephen, full of faith and power, did great wonders and miracles among the people.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-006-009" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.006.009"><span class="verse-number">9</span>Then there arose certain of the synagogue, which is called the synagogue of the Libertines, and Cyrenians, and Alexandrians, and of them of Cilicia and of Asia, disputing with Stephen.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-006-010" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.006.010"><span class="verse-number">10</span>And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by which he spake.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-006-011" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.006.011"><span class="verse-number">11</span>Then they suborned men, which said, We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses, and against God.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-006-012" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.006.012"><span class="verse-number">12</span>And they stirred up the people, and the elders, and the scribes, and came upon him, and caught him, and brought him to the council,</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-006-013" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.006.013"><span class="verse-number">13</span>And set up false witnesses, which said, This man ceaseth not to speak blasphemous words against this holy place, and the law:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-006-014" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.006.014"><span class="verse-number">14</span>For we have heard him say, that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place, and shall change the customs which Moses delivered us.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-006-015" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.006.015"><span class="verse-number">15</span>And all that sat in the council, looking stedfastly on him, saw his face as it had been the face of an angel.</p>
