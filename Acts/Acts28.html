            <p class="verse" id="v-44-028-001" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.028.001"><span class="verse-number">1</span>And when they were escaped, then they knew that the island was called Melita.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-028-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.028.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>And the barbarous people shewed us no little kindness: for they kindled a fire, and received us every one, because of the present rain, and because of the cold.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-028-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.028.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>And when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid them on the fire, there came a viper out of the heat, and fastened on his hand.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-028-004" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.028.004"><span class="verse-number">4</span>And when the barbarians saw the venomous beast hang on his hand, they said among themselves, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he hath escaped the sea, yet vengeance suffereth not to live.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-028-005" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.028.005"><span class="verse-number">5</span>And he shook off the beast into the fire, and felt no harm.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-028-006" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.028.006"><span class="verse-number">6</span>Howbeit they looked when he should have swollen, or fallen down dead suddenly: but after they had looked a great while, and saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-028-007" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.028.007"><span class="verse-number">7</span>In the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the island, whose name was Publius; who received us, and lodged us three days courteously.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-028-008" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.028.008"><span class="verse-number">8</span>And it came to pass, that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux: to whom Paul entered in, and prayed, and laid his hands on him, and healed him.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-028-009" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.028.009"><span class="verse-number">9</span>So when this was done, others also, which had diseases in the island, came, and were healed:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-028-010" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.028.010"><span class="verse-number">10</span>Who also honoured us with many honours; and when we departed, they laded us with such things as were necessary.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-028-011" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.028.011"><span class="verse-number">11</span>And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria, which had wintered in the isle, whose sign was Castor and Pollux.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-028-012" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.028.012"><span class="verse-number">12</span>And landing at Syracuse, we tarried there three days.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-028-013" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.028.013"><span class="verse-number">13</span>And from thence we fetched a compass, and came to Rhegium: and after one day the south wind blew, and we came the next day to Puteoli:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-028-014" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.028.014"><span class="verse-number">14</span>Where we found brethren, and were desired to tarry with them seven days: and so we went toward Rome.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-028-015" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.028.015"><span class="verse-number">15</span>And from thence, when the brethren heard of us, they came to meet us as far as Appii forum, and The three taverns: whom when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-028-016" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.028.016"><span class="verse-number">16</span>And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard: but Paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-028-017" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.028.017"><span class="verse-number">17</span>And it came to pass, that after three days Paul called the chief of the Jews together: and when they were come together, he said unto them, Men and brethren, though I have committed nothing against the people, or customs of our fathers, yet was I delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-028-018" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.028.018"><span class="verse-number">18</span>Who, when they had examined me, would have let me go, because there was no cause of death in me.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-028-019" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.028.019"><span class="verse-number">19</span>But when the Jews spake against it, I was constrained to appeal unto Caesar; not that I had ought to accuse my nation of.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-028-020" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.028.020"><span class="verse-number">20</span>For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see you, and to speak with you: because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-028-021" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.028.021"><span class="verse-number">21</span>And they said unto him, We neither received letters out of Judaea concerning thee, neither any of the brethren that came shewed or spake any harm of thee.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-028-022" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.028.022"><span class="verse-number">22</span>But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as concerning this sect, we know that every where it is spoken against.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-028-023" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.028.023"><span class="verse-number">23</span>And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him into his lodging; to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of God, persuading them concerning Jesus, both out of the law of Moses, and out of the prophets, from morning till evening.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-028-024" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.028.024"><span class="verse-number">24</span>And some believed the things which were spoken, and some believed not.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-028-025" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.028.025"><span class="verse-number">25</span>And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed, after that Paul had spoken one word, Well spake the Holy Ghost by Esaias the prophet unto our fathers,</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-028-026" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.028.026"><span class="verse-number">26</span>Saying, Go unto this people, and say, Hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and not perceive:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-028-027" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.028.027"><span class="verse-number">27</span>For the heart of this people is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes have they closed; lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-028-028" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.028.028"><span class="verse-number">28</span>Be it known therefore unto you, that the salvation of God is sent unto the Gentiles, and that they will hear it.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-028-029" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.028.029"><span class="verse-number">29</span>And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, and had great reasoning among themselves.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-028-030" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.028.030"><span class="verse-number">30</span>And Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house, and received all that came in unto him,</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-028-031" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.028.031"><span class="verse-number">31</span>Preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching those things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ, with all confidence, no man forbidding him.</p>
