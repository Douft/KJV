            <p class="verse" id="v-44-018-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.018.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>And because he was of the same craft, he abode with them, and wrought: for by their occupation they were tentmakers.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-018-004" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.018.004"><span class="verse-number">4</span>And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-44-018-008" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.018.008"><span class="verse-number">8</span>And Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed, and were baptized.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-018-009" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.018.009"><span class="verse-number">9</span>Then spake the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not thy peace:</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-44-018-015" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.018.015"><span class="verse-number">15</span>But if it be a question of words and names, and of your law, look ye to it; for I will be no judge of such matters.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-018-016" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.018.016"><span class="verse-number">16</span>And he drave them from the judgment seat.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-018-017" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.018.017"><span class="verse-number">17</span>Then all the Greeks took Sosthenes, the chief ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the judgment seat. And Gallio cared for none of those things.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-018-018" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.018.018"><span class="verse-number">18</span>And Paul after this tarried there yet a good while, and then took his leave of the brethren, and sailed thence into Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn his head in Cenchrea: for he had a vow.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-018-019" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.018.019"><span class="verse-number">19</span>And he came to Ephesus, and left them there: but he himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-018-020" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.018.020"><span class="verse-number">20</span>When they desired him to tarry longer time with them, he consented not;</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-018-021" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.018.021"><span class="verse-number">21</span>But bade them farewell, saying, I must by all means keep this feast that cometh in Jerusalem: but I will return again unto you, if God will. And he sailed from Ephesus.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-018-022" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.018.022"><span class="verse-number">22</span>And when he had landed at Caesarea, and gone up, and saluted the church, he went down to Antioch.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-018-023" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.018.023"><span class="verse-number">23</span>And after he had spent some time there, he departed, and went over all the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening all the disciples.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-018-024" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.018.024"><span class="verse-number">24</span>And a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man, and mighty in the scriptures, came to Ephesus.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-018-025" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.018.025"><span class="verse-number">25</span>This man was instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in the spirit, he spake and taught diligently the things of the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-018-026" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.018.026"><span class="verse-number">26</span>And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue: whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard, they took him unto them, and expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-018-027" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.018.027"><span class="verse-number">27</span>And when he was disposed to pass into Achaia, the brethren wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him: who, when he was come, helped them much which had believed through grace:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-018-028" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.018.028"><span class="verse-number">28</span>For he mightily convinced the Jews, and that publickly, shewing by the scriptures that Jesus was Christ.</p>
