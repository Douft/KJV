            <p class="verse" id="v-44-002-023" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.002.023"><span class="verse-number">23</span>Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-002-024" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.002.024"><span class="verse-number">24</span>Whom God hath raised up, having loosed the pains of death: because it was not possible that he should be holden of it.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-002-025" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.002.025"><span class="verse-number">25</span>For David speaketh concerning him, I foresaw the Lord always before my face, for he is on my right hand, that I should not be moved:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-002-026" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.002.026"><span class="verse-number">26</span>Therefore did my heart rejoice, and my tongue was glad; moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-002-027" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.002.027"><span class="verse-number">27</span>Because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-002-028" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.002.028"><span class="verse-number">28</span>Thou hast made known to me the ways of life; thou shalt make me full of joy with thy countenance.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-002-029" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.002.029"><span class="verse-number">29</span>Men and brethren, let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his sepulchre is with us unto this day.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-002-030" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.002.030"><span class="verse-number">30</span>Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne;</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-002-031" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.002.031"><span class="verse-number">31</span>He seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left in hell, neither his flesh did see corruption.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-002-032" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.002.032"><span class="verse-number">32</span>This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-002-033" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.002.033"><span class="verse-number">33</span>Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath shed forth this, which ye now see and hear.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-002-034" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.002.034"><span class="verse-number">34</span>For David is not ascended into the heavens: but he saith himself, The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-002-035" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.002.035"><span class="verse-number">35</span>Until I make thy foes thy footstool.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-002-036" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.002.036"><span class="verse-number">36</span>Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-002-037" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.002.037"><span class="verse-number">37</span>Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we do?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-002-038" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.002.038"><span class="verse-number">38</span>Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-002-039" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.002.039"><span class="verse-number">39</span>For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-002-040" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.002.040"><span class="verse-number">40</span>And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, Save yourselves from this untoward generation.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-002-041" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.002.041"><span class="verse-number">41</span>Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-002-042" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.002.042"><span class="verse-number">42</span>And they continued stedfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-002-043" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.002.043"><span class="verse-number">43</span>And fear came upon every soul: and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-002-044" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.002.044"><span class="verse-number">44</span>And all that believed were together, and had all things common;</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-002-045" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.002.045"><span class="verse-number">45</span>And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all men, as every man had need.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-002-046" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.002.046"><span class="verse-number">46</span>And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart,</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-44-002-047" data-verse-ref="KJV.44.002.047"><span class="verse-number">47</span>Praising God, and having favour with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved.</p>
