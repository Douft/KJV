            <p class="verse" id="v-40-013-006" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.013.006"><span class="verse-number">6</span>And when the sun was up, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-40-013-015" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.013.015"><span class="verse-number">15</span>For this people's heart is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes they have closed; lest at any time they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and should understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-013-016" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.013.016"><span class="verse-number">16</span>But blessed are your eyes, for they see: and your ears, for they hear.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-013-017" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.013.017"><span class="verse-number">17</span>For verily I say unto you, That many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which ye see, and have not seen them; and to hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard them.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-013-018" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.013.018"><span class="verse-number">18</span>Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower.</p>

This is he which received seed by the way side.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-013-020" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.013.020"><span class="verse-number">20</span>But he that received the seed into stony places, the same is he that heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it;</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-40-013-022" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.013.022"><span class="verse-number">22</span>He also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word; and the care of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-013-023" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.013.023"><span class="verse-number">23</span>But he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word, and understandeth it; which also beareth fruit, and bringeth forth, some an hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-013-024" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.013.024"><span class="verse-number">24</span>Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-013-025" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.013.025"><span class="verse-number">25</span>But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-013-026" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.013.026"><span class="verse-number">26</span>But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-013-027" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.013.027"><span class="verse-number">27</span>So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-013-028" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.013.028"><span class="verse-number">28</span>He said unto them, An enemy hath done this. The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-013-029" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.013.029"><span class="verse-number">29</span>But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-013-030" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.013.030"><span class="verse-number">30</span>Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-013-031" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.013.031"><span class="verse-number">31</span>Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-013-032" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.013.032"><span class="verse-number">32</span>Which indeed is the least of all seeds: but when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-013-033" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.013.033"><span class="verse-number">33</span>Another parable spake he unto them; The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-013-034" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.013.034"><span class="verse-number">34</span>All these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables; and without a parable spake he not unto them:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-013-035" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.013.035"><span class="verse-number">35</span>That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-013-036" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.013.036"><span class="verse-number">36</span>Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house: and his disciples came unto him, saying, Declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-013-037" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.013.037"><span class="verse-number">37</span>He answered and said unto them, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man;</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-013-038" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.013.038"><span class="verse-number">38</span>The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one;</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-013-039" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.013.039"><span class="verse-number">39</span>The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-013-040" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.013.040"><span class="verse-number">40</span>As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-40-013-043" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.013.043"><span class="verse-number">43</span>Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-013-044" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.013.044"><span class="verse-number">44</span>Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field; the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-013-045" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.013.045"><span class="verse-number">45</span>Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man, seeking goodly pearls:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-013-046" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.013.046"><span class="verse-number">46</span>Who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-40-013-048" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.013.048"><span class="verse-number">48</span>Which, when it was full, they drew to shore, and sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-013-049" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.013.049"><span class="verse-number">49</span>So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the just,</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-40-013-051" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.013.051"><span class="verse-number">51</span>Jesus saith unto them, Have ye understood all these things? They say unto him, Yea, Lord.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-013-052" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.013.052"><span class="verse-number">52</span>Then said he unto them, Therefore every scribe which is instructed unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder, which bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and old.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-013-053" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.013.053"><span class="verse-number">53</span>And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these parables, he departed thence.</p>
