            <p class="verse" id="v-40-014-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.014.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>For Herod had laid hold on John, and bound him, and put him in prison for Herodias' sake, his brother Philip's wife.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-014-004" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.014.004"><span class="verse-number">4</span>For John said unto him, It is not lawful for thee to have her.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-40-014-020" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.014.020"><span class="verse-number">20</span>And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the fragments that remained twelve baskets full.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-014-021" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.014.021"><span class="verse-number">21</span>And they that had eaten were about five thousand men, beside women and children.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-40-014-023" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.014.023"><span class="verse-number">23</span>And when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into a mountain apart to pray: and when the evening was come, he was there alone.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-014-024" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.014.024"><span class="verse-number">24</span>But the ship was now in the midst of the sea, tossed with waves: for the wind was contrary.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-014-025" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.014.025"><span class="verse-number">25</span>And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went unto them, walking on the sea.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-014-026" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.014.026"><span class="verse-number">26</span>And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, It is a spirit; and they cried out for fear.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-014-027" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.014.027"><span class="verse-number">27</span>But straightway Jesus spake unto them, saying, Be of good cheer; it is I; be not afraid.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-014-028" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.014.028"><span class="verse-number">28</span>And Peter answered him and said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee on the water.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-014-029" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.014.029"><span class="verse-number">29</span>And he said, Come. And when Peter was come down out of the ship, he walked on the water, to go to Jesus.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-014-030" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.014.030"><span class="verse-number">30</span>But when he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-014-031" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.014.031"><span class="verse-number">31</span>And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand, and caught him, and said unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-014-032" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.014.032"><span class="verse-number">32</span>And when they were come into the ship, the wind ceased.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-014-033" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.014.033"><span class="verse-number">33</span>Then they that were in the ship came and worshipped him, saying, Of a truth thou art the Son of God.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-014-034" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.014.034"><span class="verse-number">34</span>And when they were gone over, they came into the land of Gennesaret.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-014-035" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.014.035"><span class="verse-number">35</span>And when the men of that place had knowledge of him, they sent out into all that country round about, and brought unto him all that were diseased;</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-014-036" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.014.036"><span class="verse-number">36</span>And besought him that they might only touch the hem of his garment: and as many as touched were made perfectly whole.</p>
