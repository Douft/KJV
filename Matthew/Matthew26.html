            <p class="verse" id="v-40-026-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.026.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>Ye know that after two days is the feast of the passover, and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-026-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.026.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>Then assembled together the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders of the people, unto the palace of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas,</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-026-004" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.026.004"><span class="verse-number">4</span>And consulted that they might take Jesus by subtilty, and kill him.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-026-005" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.026.005"><span class="verse-number">5</span>But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar among the people.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-026-006" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.026.006"><span class="verse-number">6</span>Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-026-007" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.026.007"><span class="verse-number">7</span>There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat at meat.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-026-008" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.026.008"><span class="verse-number">8</span>But when his disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, To what purpose is this waste?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-026-009" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.026.009"><span class="verse-number">9</span>For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-026-010" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.026.010"><span class="verse-number">10</span>When Jesus understood it, he said unto them, Why trouble ye the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-026-011" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.026.011"><span class="verse-number">11</span>For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-026-012" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.026.012"><span class="verse-number">12</span>For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did it for my burial.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-40-026-014" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.026.014"><span class="verse-number">14</span>Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went unto the chief priests,</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-026-015" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.026.015"><span class="verse-number">15</span>And said unto them, What will ye give me, and I will deliver him unto you? And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-026-016" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.026.016"><span class="verse-number">16</span>And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-026-017" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.026.017"><span class="verse-number">17</span>Now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-026-018" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.026.018"><span class="verse-number">18</span>And he said, Go into the city to such a man, and say unto him, The Master saith, My time is at hand; I will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-026-019" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.026.019"><span class="verse-number">19</span>And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them; and they made ready the passover.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-026-020" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.026.020"><span class="verse-number">20</span>Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-026-021" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.026.021"><span class="verse-number">21</span>And as they did eat, he said, Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-026-022" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.026.022"><span class="verse-number">22</span>And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them to say unto him, Lord, is it I?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-026-023" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.026.023"><span class="verse-number">23</span>And he answered and said, He that dippeth his hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-026-024" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.026.024"><span class="verse-number">24</span>The Son of man goeth as it is written of him: but woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it had been good for that man if he had not been born.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-026-025" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.026.025"><span class="verse-number">25</span>Then Judas, which betrayed him, answered and said, Master, is it I? He said unto him, Thou hast said.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-026-026" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.026.026"><span class="verse-number">26</span>And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-026-027" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.026.027"><span class="verse-number">27</span>And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it;</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-026-028" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.026.028"><span class="verse-number">28</span>For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-026-029" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.026.029"><span class="verse-number">29</span>But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-026-030" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.026.030"><span class="verse-number">30</span>And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-026-031" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.026.031"><span class="verse-number">31</span>Then saith Jesus unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-026-032" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.026.032"><span class="verse-number">32</span>But after I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-026-033" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.026.033"><span class="verse-number">33</span>Peter answered and said unto him, Though all men shall be offended because of thee, yet will I never be offended.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-026-034" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.026.034"><span class="verse-number">34</span>Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-026-035" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.026.035"><span class="verse-number">35</span>Peter said unto him, Though I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-026-036" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.026.036"><span class="verse-number">36</span>Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane, and saith unto the disciples, Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-026-037" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.026.037"><span class="verse-number">37</span>And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and very heavy.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-026-038" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.026.038"><span class="verse-number">38</span>Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-026-039" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.026.039"><span class="verse-number">39</span>And he went a little further, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-026-040" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.026.040"><span class="verse-number">40</span>And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and saith unto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-026-041" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.026.041"><span class="verse-number">41</span>Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-026-042" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.026.042"><span class="verse-number">42</span>He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-026-043" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.026.043"><span class="verse-number">43</span>And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were heavy.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-026-044" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.026.044"><span class="verse-number">44</span>And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-026-045" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.026.045"><span class="verse-number">45</span>Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-026-046" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.026.046"><span class="verse-number">46</span>Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that doth betray me.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-026-047" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.026.047"><span class="verse-number">47</span>And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and elders of the people.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-026-048" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.026.048"><span class="verse-number">48</span>Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he: hold him fast.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-026-049" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.026.049"><span class="verse-number">49</span>And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and kissed him.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-026-050" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.026.050"><span class="verse-number">50</span>And Jesus said unto him, Friend, wherefore art thou come? Then came they, and laid hands on Jesus, and took him.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-026-051" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.026.051"><span class="verse-number">51</span>And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high priest's, and smote off his ear.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-026-052" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.026.052"><span class="verse-number">52</span>Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-026-053" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.026.053"><span class="verse-number">53</span>Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-026-054" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.026.054"><span class="verse-number">54</span>But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-026-055" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.026.055"><span class="verse-number">55</span>In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no hold on me.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-026-056" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.026.056"><span class="verse-number">56</span>But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-026-057" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.026.057"><span class="verse-number">57</span>And they that had laid hold on Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-026-058" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.026.058"><span class="verse-number">58</span>But Peter followed him afar off unto the high priest's palace, and went in, and sat with the servants, to see the end.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-026-059" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.026.059"><span class="verse-number">59</span>Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought false witness against Jesus, to put him to death;</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-026-060" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.026.060"><span class="verse-number">60</span>But found none: yea, though many false witnesses came, yet found they none. At the last came two false witnesses,</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-026-061" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.026.061"><span class="verse-number">61</span>And said, This fellow said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-026-062" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.026.062"><span class="verse-number">62</span>And the high priest arose, and said unto him, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-026-063" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.026.063"><span class="verse-number">63</span>But Jesus held his peace. And the high priest answered and said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-026-064" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.026.064"><span class="verse-number">64</span>Jesus saith unto him, Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-026-065" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.026.065"><span class="verse-number">65</span>Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now ye have heard his blasphemy.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-026-066" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.026.066"><span class="verse-number">66</span>What think ye? They answered and said, He is guilty of death.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-026-067" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.026.067"><span class="verse-number">67</span>Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others smote him with the palms of their hands,</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-026-068" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.026.068"><span class="verse-number">68</span>Saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ, Who is he that smote thee?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-026-069" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.026.069"><span class="verse-number">69</span>Now Peter sat without in the palace: and a damsel came unto him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-026-070" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.026.070"><span class="verse-number">70</span>But he denied before them all, saying, I know not what thou sayest.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-026-071" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.026.071"><span class="verse-number">71</span>And when he was gone out into the porch, another maid saw him, and said unto them that were there, This fellow was also with Jesus of Nazareth.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-026-072" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.026.072"><span class="verse-number">72</span>And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-026-073" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.026.073"><span class="verse-number">73</span>And after a while came unto him they that stood by, and said to Peter, Surely thou also art one of them; for thy speech bewrayeth thee.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-026-074" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.026.074"><span class="verse-number">74</span>Then began he to curse and to swear, saying, I know not the man. And immediately the cock crew.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-026-075" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.026.075"><span class="verse-number">75</span>And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept bitterly.</p>
