            <p class="verse" id="v-40-006-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.006.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>Therefore when thou doest thine alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-006-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.006.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-006-004" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.006.004"><span class="verse-number">4</span>That thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-006-005" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.006.005"><span class="verse-number">5</span>And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-006-006" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.006.006"><span class="verse-number">6</span>But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-006-007" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.006.007"><span class="verse-number">7</span>But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-006-008" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.006.008"><span class="verse-number">8</span>Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-006-009" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.006.009"><span class="verse-number">9</span>After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-40-006-014" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.006.014"><span class="verse-number">14</span>For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-006-015" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.006.015"><span class="verse-number">15</span>But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-006-016" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.006.016"><span class="verse-number">16</span>Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-006-017" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.006.017"><span class="verse-number">17</span>But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face;</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-006-018" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.006.018"><span class="verse-number">18</span>That thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father which is in secret: and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-40-006-020" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.006.020"><span class="verse-number">20</span>But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal:</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-40-006-023" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.006.023"><span class="verse-number">23</span>But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is that darkness!</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-006-024" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.006.024"><span class="verse-number">24</span>No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-006-025" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.006.025"><span class="verse-number">25</span>Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-006-026" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.006.026"><span class="verse-number">26</span>Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-006-027" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.006.027"><span class="verse-number">27</span>Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-006-028" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.006.028"><span class="verse-number">28</span>And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-006-029" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.006.029"><span class="verse-number">29</span>And yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-006-030" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.006.030"><span class="verse-number">30</span>Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-006-031" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.006.031"><span class="verse-number">31</span>Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-006-032" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.006.032"><span class="verse-number">32</span>(For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.</p>
