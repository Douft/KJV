            <p class="verse" id="v-40-015-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.015.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-015-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.015.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>But he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-015-004" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.015.004"><span class="verse-number">4</span>For God commanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother: and, He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-015-005" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.015.005"><span class="verse-number">5</span>But ye say, Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother, It is a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me;</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-015-006" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.015.006"><span class="verse-number">6</span>And honour not his father or his mother, he shall be free. Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-40-015-009" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.015.009"><span class="verse-number">9</span>But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-40-015-018" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.015.018"><span class="verse-number">18</span>But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and they defile the man.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-015-019" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.015.019"><span class="verse-number">19</span>For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-015-020" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.015.020"><span class="verse-number">20</span>These are the things which defile a man: but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-015-021" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.015.021"><span class="verse-number">21</span>Then Jesus went thence, and departed into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-40-015-023" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.015.023"><span class="verse-number">23</span>But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-015-024" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.015.024"><span class="verse-number">24</span>But he answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-015-025" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.015.025"><span class="verse-number">25</span>Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-015-026" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.015.026"><span class="verse-number">26</span>But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it to dogs.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-015-027" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.015.027"><span class="verse-number">27</span>And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters' table.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-015-028" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.015.028"><span class="verse-number">28</span>Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman, great is thy faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was made whole from that very hour.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-015-029" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.015.029"><span class="verse-number">29</span>And Jesus departed from thence, and came nigh unto the sea of Galilee; and went up into a mountain, and sat down there.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-015-030" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.015.030"><span class="verse-number">30</span>And great multitudes came unto him, having with them those that were lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and cast them down at Jesus' feet; and he healed them:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-015-031" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.015.031"><span class="verse-number">31</span>Insomuch that the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb to speak, the maimed to be whole, the lame to walk, and the blind to see: and they glorified the God of Israel.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-015-032" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.015.032"><span class="verse-number">32</span>Then Jesus called his disciples unto him, and said, I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days, and have nothing to eat: and I will not send them away fasting, lest they faint in the way.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-015-033" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.015.033"><span class="verse-number">33</span>And his disciples say unto him, Whence should we have so much bread in the wilderness, as to fill so great a multitude?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-015-034" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.015.034"><span class="verse-number">34</span>And Jesus saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven, and a few little fishes.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-015-035" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.015.035"><span class="verse-number">35</span>And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-015-036" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.015.036"><span class="verse-number">36</span>And he took the seven loaves and the fishes, and gave thanks, and brake them, and gave to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-015-037" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.015.037"><span class="verse-number">37</span>And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets full.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-015-038" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.015.038"><span class="verse-number">38</span>And they that did eat were four thousand men, beside women and children.</p>
