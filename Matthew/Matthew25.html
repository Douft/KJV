            <p class="verse" id="v-40-025-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.025.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>And five of them were wise, and five were foolish.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-40-025-010" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.025.010"><span class="verse-number">10</span>And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door was shut.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-40-025-025" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.025.025"><span class="verse-number">25</span>And I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, there thou hast that is thine.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-025-026" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.025.026"><span class="verse-number">26</span>His lord answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I have not strawed:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-025-027" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.025.027"><span class="verse-number">27</span>Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and then at my coming I should have received mine own with usury.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-025-028" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.025.028"><span class="verse-number">28</span>Take therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him which hath ten talents.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-025-029" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.025.029"><span class="verse-number">29</span>For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath.</p>
