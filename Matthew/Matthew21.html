            <p class="verse" id="v-40-021-022" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.021.022"><span class="verse-number">22</span>And all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-40-021-024" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.021.024"><span class="verse-number">24</span>And Jesus answered and said unto them, I also will ask you one thing, which if ye tell me, I in like wise will tell you by what authority I do these things.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-021-025" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.021.025"><span class="verse-number">25</span>The baptism of John, whence was it? from heaven, or of men? And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say unto us, Why did ye not then believe him?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-021-026" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.021.026"><span class="verse-number">26</span>But if we shall say, Of men; we fear the people; for all hold John as a prophet.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-021-027" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.021.027"><span class="verse-number">27</span>And they answered Jesus, and said, We cannot tell. And he said unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-021-028" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.021.028"><span class="verse-number">28</span>But what think ye? A certain man had two sons; and he came to the first, and said, Son, go work to day in my vineyard.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-021-029" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.021.029"><span class="verse-number">29</span>He answered and said, I will not: but afterward he repented, and went.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-021-030" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.021.030"><span class="verse-number">30</span>And he came to the second, and said likewise. And he answered and said, I go, sir: and went not.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-40-021-032" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.021.032"><span class="verse-number">32</span>For John came unto you in the way of righteousness, and ye believed him not: but the publicans and the harlots believed him: and ye, when ye had seen it, repented not afterward, that ye might believe him.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-021-033" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.021.033"><span class="verse-number">33</span>Hear another parable: There was a certain householder, which planted a vineyard, and hedged it round about, and digged a winepress in it, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-021-034" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.021.034"><span class="verse-number">34</span>And when the time of the fruit drew near, he sent his servants to the husbandmen, that they might receive the fruits of it.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-021-035" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.021.035"><span class="verse-number">35</span>And the husbandmen took his servants, and beat one, and killed another, and stoned another.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-021-036" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.021.036"><span class="verse-number">36</span>Again, he sent other servants more than the first: and they did unto them likewise.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-021-037" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.021.037"><span class="verse-number">37</span>But last of all he sent unto them his son, saying, They will reverence my son.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-021-038" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.021.038"><span class="verse-number">38</span>But when the husbandmen saw the son, they said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and let us seize on his inheritance.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-021-039" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.021.039"><span class="verse-number">39</span>And they caught him, and cast him out of the vineyard, and slew him.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-021-040" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.021.040"><span class="verse-number">40</span>When the lord therefore of the vineyard cometh, what will he do unto those husbandmen?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-021-041" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.021.041"><span class="verse-number">41</span>They say unto him, He will miserably destroy those wicked men, and will let out his vineyard unto other husbandmen, which shall render him the fruits in their seasons.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-021-042" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.021.042"><span class="verse-number">42</span>Jesus saith unto them, Did ye never read in the scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner: this is the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-021-043" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.021.043"><span class="verse-number">43</span>Therefore say I unto you, The kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-021-044" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.021.044"><span class="verse-number">44</span>And whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken: but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-021-045" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.021.045"><span class="verse-number">45</span>And when the chief priests and Pharisees had heard his parables, they perceived that he spake of them.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-40-021-046" data-verse-ref="KJV.40.021.046"><span class="verse-number">46</span>But when they sought to lay hands on him, they feared the multitude, because they took him for a prophet.</p>
