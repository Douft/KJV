            <p class="verse" id="v-08-003-016" data-verse-ref="KJV.08.003.016"><span class="verse-number">16</span>And when she came to her mother in law, she said, Who art thou, my daughter? And she told her all that the man had done to her.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-08-003-017" data-verse-ref="KJV.08.003.017"><span class="verse-number">17</span>And she said, These six measures of barley gave he me; for he said to me, Go not empty unto thy mother in law.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-08-003-018" data-verse-ref="KJV.08.003.018"><span class="verse-number">18</span>Then said she, Sit still, my daughter, until thou know how the matter will fall: for the man will not be in rest, until he have finished the thing this day.</p>
