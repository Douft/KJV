            <p class="verse" id="v-51-002-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.51.002.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>That their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love, and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the acknowledgement of the mystery of God, and of the Father, and of Christ;</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-51-002-019" data-verse-ref="KJV.51.002.019"><span class="verse-number">19</span>And not holding the Head, from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increaseth with the increase of God.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-51-002-020" data-verse-ref="KJV.51.002.020"><span class="verse-number">20</span>Wherefore if ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the world, are ye subject to ordinances,</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-51-002-023" data-verse-ref="KJV.51.002.023"><span class="verse-number">23</span>Which things have indeed a shew of wisdom in will worship, and humility, and neglecting of the body; not in any honour to the satisfying of the flesh.</p>
