# Roadmap

_Last updated: 2026-02-23_

## Now

- **Bible chapters: single-verse UX everywhere (Genesis 1 style)**
  - Default to showing **one verse at a time** even when timing metadata is missing.
  - While creating timings, verse changes must be **manual only** (no auto-advance).
  - Once timings exist (provided/entered later), enable **auto-advance based on timings**.
  - Timing mode should not fight playback-driven `timeupdate` handlers.

## Next

- Enter timings for remaining chapters as they are created.
- Decide how/where to persist finalized timings (embedded `highlight-times` JSON vs localStorage vs a server endpoint).

## Later

- (Add future items here as they come up.)
