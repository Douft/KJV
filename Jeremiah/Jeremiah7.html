            <p class="verse" id="v-24-007-021" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.007.021"><span class="verse-number">21</span>Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Put your burnt offerings unto your sacrifices, and eat flesh.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-007-022" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.007.022"><span class="verse-number">22</span>For I spake not unto your fathers, nor commanded them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning burnt offerings or sacrifices:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-007-023" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.007.023"><span class="verse-number">23</span>But this thing commanded I them, saying, Obey my voice, and I will be your God, and ye shall be my people: and walk ye in all the ways that I have commanded you, that it may be well unto you.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-007-024" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.007.024"><span class="verse-number">24</span>But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear, but walked in the counsels and in the imagination of their evil heart, and went backward, and not forward.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-007-025" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.007.025"><span class="verse-number">25</span>Since the day that your fathers came forth out of the land of Egypt unto this day I have even sent unto you all my servants the prophets, daily rising up early and sending them:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-007-026" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.007.026"><span class="verse-number">26</span>Yet they hearkened not unto me, nor inclined their ear, but hardened their neck: they did worse than their fathers.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-007-027" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.007.027"><span class="verse-number">27</span>Therefore thou shalt speak all these words unto them; but they will not hearken to thee: thou shalt also call unto them; but they will not answer thee.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-007-028" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.007.028"><span class="verse-number">28</span>But thou shalt say unto them, This is a nation that obeyeth not the voice of the LORD their God, nor receiveth correction: truth is perished, and is cut off from their mouth.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-007-029" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.007.029"><span class="verse-number">29</span>Cut off thine hair, O Jerusalem, and cast it away, and take up a lamentation on high places; for the LORD hath rejected and forsaken the generation of his wrath.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-007-030" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.007.030"><span class="verse-number">30</span>For the children of Judah have done evil in my sight, saith the LORD: they have set their abominations in the house which is called by my name, to pollute it.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-007-031" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.007.031"><span class="verse-number">31</span>And they have built the high places of Tophet, which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my heart.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-007-032" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.007.032"><span class="verse-number">32</span>Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that it shall no more be called Tophet, nor the valley of the son of Hinnom, but the valley of slaughter: for they shall bury in Tophet, till there be no place.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-007-033" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.007.033"><span class="verse-number">33</span>And the carcases of this people shall be meat for the fowls of the heaven, and for the beasts of the earth; and none shall fray them away.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-007-034" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.007.034"><span class="verse-number">34</span>Then will I cause to cease from the cities of Judah, and from the streets of Jerusalem, the voice of mirth, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride: for the land shall be desolate.</p>
