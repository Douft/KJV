            <p class="verse" id="v-24-042-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.042.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>That the LORD thy God may shew us the way wherein we may walk, and the thing that we may do.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-24-042-005" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.042.005"><span class="verse-number">5</span>Then they said to Jeremiah, The LORD be a true and faithful witness between us, if we do not even according to all things for the which the LORD thy God shall send thee to us.</p>
