            <p class="verse" id="v-24-021-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.021.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>Inquire, I pray thee, of the LORD for us; for Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon maketh war against us; if so be that the LORD will deal with us according to all his wondrous works, that he may go up from us.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-021-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.021.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>Then said Jeremiah unto them, Thus shall ye say to Zedekiah:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-021-004" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.021.004"><span class="verse-number">4</span>Thus saith the LORD God of Israel; Behold, I will turn back the weapons of war that are in your hands, wherewith ye fight against the king of Babylon, and against the Chaldeans, which besiege you without the walls, and I will assemble them into the midst of this city.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-021-005" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.021.005"><span class="verse-number">5</span>And I myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and with a strong arm, even in anger, and in fury, and in great wrath.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-021-006" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.021.006"><span class="verse-number">6</span>And I will smite the inhabitants of this city, both man and beast: they shall die of a great pestilence.</p>
