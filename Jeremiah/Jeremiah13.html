            <p class="verse" id="v-24-013-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.013.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>So I got a girdle according to the word of the LORD, and put it on my loins.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-013-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.013.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>And the word of the LORD came unto me the second time, saying,</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-013-004" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.013.004"><span class="verse-number">4</span>Take the girdle that thou hast got, which is upon thy loins, and arise, go to Euphrates, and hide it there in a hole of the rock.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-013-005" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.013.005"><span class="verse-number">5</span>So I went, and hid it by Euphrates, as the LORD commanded me.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-013-006" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.013.006"><span class="verse-number">6</span>And it came to pass after many days, that the LORD said unto me, Arise, go to Euphrates, and take the girdle from thence, which I commanded thee to hide there.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-013-007" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.013.007"><span class="verse-number">7</span>Then I went to Euphrates, and digged, and took the girdle from the place where I had hid it: and, behold, the girdle was marred, it was profitable for nothing.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-24-013-022" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.013.022"><span class="verse-number">22</span>And if thou say in thine heart, Wherefore come these things upon me? For the greatness of thine iniquity are thy skirts discovered, and thy heels made bare.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-013-023" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.013.023"><span class="verse-number">23</span>Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots? then may ye also do good, that are accustomed to do evil.</p>
