            <p class="verse" id="v-24-035-004" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.035.004"><span class="verse-number">4</span>And I brought them into the house of the LORD, into the chamber of the sons of Hanan, the son of Igdaliah, a man of God, which was by the chamber of the princes, which was above the chamber of Maaseiah the son of Shallum, the keeper of the door:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-035-005" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.035.005"><span class="verse-number">5</span>And I set before the sons of the house of the Rechabites pots full of wine, and cups, and I said unto them, Drink ye wine.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-24-035-015" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.035.015"><span class="verse-number">15</span>I have sent also unto you all my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them, saying, Return ye now every man from his evil way, and amend your doings, and go not after other gods to serve them, and ye shall dwell in the land which I have given to you and to your fathers: but ye have not inclined your ear, nor hearkened unto me.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-035-016" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.035.016"><span class="verse-number">16</span>Because the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have performed the commandment of their father, which he commanded them; but this people hath not hearkened unto me:</p>
