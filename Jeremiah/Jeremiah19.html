            <p class="verse" id="v-24-019-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.019.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>And go forth unto the valley of the son of Hinnom, which is by the entry of the east gate, and proclaim there the words that I shall tell thee,</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-019-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.019.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>And say, Hear ye the word of the LORD, O kings of Judah, and inhabitants of Jerusalem; Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, the which whosoever heareth, his ears shall tingle.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-019-004" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.019.004"><span class="verse-number">4</span>Because they have forsaken me, and have estranged this place, and have burned incense in it unto other gods, whom neither they nor their fathers have known, nor the kings of Judah, and have filled this place with the blood of innocents;</p>
