            <p class="verse" id="v-24-002-006" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.002.006"><span class="verse-number">6</span>Neither said they, Where is the LORD that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, that led us through the wilderness, through a land of deserts and of pits, through a land of drought, and of the shadow of death, through a land that no man passed through, and where no man dwelt?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-002-007" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.002.007"><span class="verse-number">7</span>And I brought you into a plentiful country, to eat the fruit thereof and the goodness thereof; but when ye entered, ye defiled my land, and made mine heritage an abomination.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-24-002-020" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.002.020"><span class="verse-number">20</span>For of old time I have broken thy yoke, and burst thy bands; and thou saidst, I will not transgress; when upon every high hill and under every green tree thou wanderest, playing the harlot.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-002-021" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.002.021"><span class="verse-number">21</span>Yet I had planted thee a noble vine, wholly a right seed: how then art thou turned into the degenerate plant of a strange vine unto me?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-002-022" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.002.022"><span class="verse-number">22</span>For though thou wash thee with nitre, and take thee much soap, yet thine iniquity is marked before me, saith the Lord GOD.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-002-023" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.002.023"><span class="verse-number">23</span>How canst thou say, I am not polluted, I have not gone after Baalim? see thy way in the valley, know what thou hast done: thou art a swift dromedary traversing her ways;</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-002-024" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.002.024"><span class="verse-number">24</span>A wild ass used to the wilderness, that snuffeth up the wind at her pleasure; in her occasion who can turn her away? all they that seek her will not weary themselves; in her month they shall find her.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-002-025" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.002.025"><span class="verse-number">25</span>Withhold thy foot from being unshod, and thy throat from thirst: but thou saidst, There is no hope: no; for I have loved strangers, and after them will I go.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-002-026" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.002.026"><span class="verse-number">26</span>As the thief is ashamed when he is found, so is the house of Israel ashamed; they, their kings, their princes, and their priests, and their prophets,</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-002-027" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.002.027"><span class="verse-number">27</span>Saying to a stock, Thou art my father; and to a stone, Thou hast brought me forth: for they have turned their back unto me, and not their face: but in the time of their trouble they will say, Arise, and save us.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-002-028" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.002.028"><span class="verse-number">28</span>But where are thy gods that thou hast made thee? let them arise, if they can save thee in the time of thy trouble: for according to the number of thy cities are thy gods, O Judah.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-002-029" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.002.029"><span class="verse-number">29</span>Wherefore will ye plead with me? ye all have transgressed against me, saith the LORD.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-24-002-031" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.002.031"><span class="verse-number">31</span>O generation, see ye the word of the LORD. Have I been a wilderness unto Israel? a land of darkness? wherefore say my people, We are lords; we will come no more unto thee?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-002-032" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.002.032"><span class="verse-number">32</span>Can a maid forget her ornaments, or a bride her attire? yet my people have forgotten me days without number.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-002-033" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.002.033"><span class="verse-number">33</span>Why trimmest thou thy way to seek love? therefore hast thou also taught the wicked ones thy ways.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-002-034" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.002.034"><span class="verse-number">34</span>Also in thy skirts is found the blood of the souls of the poor innocents: I have not found it by secret search, but upon all these.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-002-035" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.002.035"><span class="verse-number">35</span>Yet thou sayest, Because I am innocent, surely his anger shall turn from me. Behold, I will plead with thee, because thou sayest, I have not sinned.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-002-036" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.002.036"><span class="verse-number">36</span>Why gaddest thou about so much to change thy way? thou also shalt be ashamed of Egypt, as thou wast ashamed of Assyria.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-002-037" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.002.037"><span class="verse-number">37</span>Yea, thou shalt go forth from him, and thine hands upon thine head: for the LORD hath rejected thy confidences, and thou shalt not prosper in them.</p>
