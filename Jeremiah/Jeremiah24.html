            <p class="verse" id="v-24-024-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.024.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>One basket had very good figs, even like the figs that are first ripe: and the other basket had very naughty figs, which could not be eaten, they were so bad.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-024-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.024.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>Then said the LORD unto me, What seest thou, Jeremiah? And I said, Figs; the good figs, very good; and the evil, very evil, that cannot be eaten, they are so evil.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-024-004" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.024.004"><span class="verse-number">4</span>Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-024-005" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.024.005"><span class="verse-number">5</span>Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; Like these good figs, so will I acknowledge them that are carried away captive of Judah, whom I have sent out of this place into the land of the Chaldeans for their good.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-024-006" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.024.006"><span class="verse-number">6</span>For I will set mine eyes upon them for good, and I will bring them again to this land: and I will build them, and not pull them down; and I will plant them, and not pluck them up.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-024-007" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.024.007"><span class="verse-number">7</span>And I will give them an heart to know me, that I am the LORD: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God: for they shall return unto me with their whole heart.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-024-008" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.024.008"><span class="verse-number">8</span>And as the evil figs, which cannot be eaten, they are so evil; surely thus saith the LORD, So will I give Zedekiah the king of Judah, and his princes, and the residue of Jerusalem, that remain in this land, and them that dwell in the land of Egypt:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-024-009" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.024.009"><span class="verse-number">9</span>And I will deliver them to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth for their hurt, to be a reproach and a proverb, a taunt and a curse, in all places whither I shall drive them.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-024-010" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.024.010"><span class="verse-number">10</span>And I will send the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, among them, till they be consumed from off the land that I gave unto them and to their fathers.</p>
