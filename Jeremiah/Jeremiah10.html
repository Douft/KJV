            <p class="verse" id="v-24-010-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.010.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>Thus saith the LORD, Learn not the way of the heathen, and be not dismayed at the signs of heaven; for the heathen are dismayed at them.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-010-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.010.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>For the customs of the people are vain: for one cutteth a tree out of the forest, the work of the hands of the workman, with the axe.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-010-004" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.010.004"><span class="verse-number">4</span>They deck it with silver and with gold; they fasten it with nails and with hammers, that it move not.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-010-005" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.010.005"><span class="verse-number">5</span>They are upright as the palm tree, but speak not: they must needs be borne, because they cannot go. Be not afraid of them; for they cannot do evil, neither also is it in them to do good.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-010-006" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.010.006"><span class="verse-number">6</span>Forasmuch as there is none like unto thee, O LORD; thou art great, and thy name is great in might.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-010-007" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.010.007"><span class="verse-number">7</span>Who would not fear thee, O King of nations? for to thee doth it appertain: forasmuch as among all the wise men of the nations, and in all their kingdoms, there is none like unto thee.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-010-008" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.010.008"><span class="verse-number">8</span>But they are altogether brutish and foolish: the stock is a doctrine of vanities.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-010-009" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.010.009"><span class="verse-number">9</span>Silver spread into plates is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the workman, and of the hands of the founder: blue and purple is their clothing: they are all the work of cunning men.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-010-010" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.010.010"><span class="verse-number">10</span>But the LORD is the true God, he is the living God, and an everlasting king: at his wrath the earth shall tremble, and the nations shall not be able to abide his indignation.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-010-011" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.010.011"><span class="verse-number">11</span>Thus shall ye say unto them, The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, even they shall perish from the earth, and from under these heavens.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-24-010-021" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.010.021"><span class="verse-number">21</span>For the pastors are become brutish, and have not sought the LORD: therefore they shall not prosper, and all their flocks shall be scattered.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-010-022" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.010.022"><span class="verse-number">22</span>Behold, the noise of the bruit is come, and a great commotion out of the north country, to make the cities of Judah desolate, and a den of dragons.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-010-023" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.010.023"><span class="verse-number">23</span>O LORD, I know that the way of man is not in himself: it is not in man that walketh to direct his steps.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-010-024" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.010.024"><span class="verse-number">24</span>O LORD, correct me, but with judgment; not in thine anger, lest thou bring me to nothing.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-010-025" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.010.025"><span class="verse-number">25</span>Pour out thy fury upon the heathen that know thee not, and upon the families that call not on thy name: for they have eaten up Jacob, and devoured him, and consumed him, and have made his habitation desolate.</p>
