            <p class="verse" id="v-24-005-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.005.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>And though they say, The LORD liveth; surely they swear falsely.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-24-005-004" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.005.004"><span class="verse-number">4</span>Therefore I said, Surely these are poor; they are foolish: for they know not the way of the LORD, nor the judgment of their God.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-005-005" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.005.005"><span class="verse-number">5</span>I will get me unto the great men, and will speak unto them; for they have known the way of the LORD, and the judgment of their God: but these have altogether broken the yoke, and burst the bonds.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-005-006" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.005.006"><span class="verse-number">6</span>Wherefore a lion out of the forest shall slay them, and a wolf of the evenings shall spoil them, a leopard shall watch over their cities: every one that goeth out thence shall be torn in pieces: because their transgressions are many, and their backslidings are increased.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-005-007" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.005.007"><span class="verse-number">7</span>How shall I pardon thee for this? thy children have forsaken me, and sworn by them that are no gods: when I had fed them to the full, they then committed adultery, and assembled themselves by troops in the harlots' houses.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-005-008" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.005.008"><span class="verse-number">8</span>They were as fed horses in the morning: every one neighed after his neighbour's wife.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-24-005-018" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.005.018"><span class="verse-number">18</span>Nevertheless in those days, saith the LORD, I will not make a full end with you.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-24-005-020" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.005.020"><span class="verse-number">20</span>Declare this in the house of Jacob, and publish it in Judah, saying,</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-24-005-023" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.005.023"><span class="verse-number">23</span>But this people hath a revolting and a rebellious heart; they are revolted and gone.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-24-005-026" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.005.026"><span class="verse-number">26</span>For among my people are found wicked men: they lay wait, as he that setteth snares; they set a trap, they catch men.</p>
