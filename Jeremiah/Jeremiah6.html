            <p class="verse" id="v-24-006-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.006.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>I have likened the daughter of Zion to a comely and delicate woman.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-24-006-004" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.006.004"><span class="verse-number">4</span>Prepare ye war against her; arise, and let us go up at noon. Woe unto us! for the day goeth away, for the shadows of the evening are stretched out.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-006-005" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.006.005"><span class="verse-number">5</span>Arise, and let us go by night, and let us destroy her palaces.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-006-006" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.006.006"><span class="verse-number">6</span>For thus hath the LORD of hosts said, Hew ye down trees, and cast a mount against Jerusalem: this is the city to be visited; she is wholly oppression in the midst of her.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-006-007" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.006.007"><span class="verse-number">7</span>As a fountain casteth out her waters, so she casteth out her wickedness: violence and spoil is heard in her; before me continually is grief and wounds.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-006-008" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.006.008"><span class="verse-number">8</span>Be thou instructed, O Jerusalem, lest my soul depart from thee; lest I make thee desolate, a land not inhabited.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-006-009" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.006.009"><span class="verse-number">9</span>Thus saith the LORD of hosts, They shall throughly glean the remnant of Israel as a vine: turn back thine hand as a grapegatherer into the baskets.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-24-006-011" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.006.011"><span class="verse-number">11</span>Therefore I am full of the fury of the LORD; I am weary with holding in: I will pour it out upon the children abroad, and upon the assembly of young men together: for even the husband with the wife shall be taken, the aged with him that is full of days.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-006-012" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.006.012"><span class="verse-number">12</span>And their houses shall be turned unto others, with their fields and wives together: for I will stretch out my hand upon the inhabitants of the land, saith the LORD.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-006-013" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.006.013"><span class="verse-number">13</span>For from the least of them even unto the greatest of them every one is given to covetousness; and from the prophet even unto the priest every one dealeth falsely.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-006-014" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.006.014"><span class="verse-number">14</span>They have healed also the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-006-015" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.006.015"><span class="verse-number">15</span>Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush: therefore they shall fall among them that fall: at the time that I visit them they shall be cast down, saith the LORD.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-006-016" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.006.016"><span class="verse-number">16</span>Thus saith the LORD, Stand ye in the ways, and see, and ask for the old paths, where is the good way, and walk therein, and ye shall find rest for your souls. But they said, We will not walk therein.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-24-006-019" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.006.019"><span class="verse-number">19</span>Hear, O earth: behold, I will bring evil upon this people, even the fruit of their thoughts, because they have not hearkened unto my words, nor to my law, but rejected it.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-006-020" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.006.020"><span class="verse-number">20</span>To what purpose cometh there to me incense from Sheba, and the sweet cane from a far country? your burnt offerings are not acceptable, nor your sacrifices sweet unto me.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-006-021" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.006.021"><span class="verse-number">21</span>Therefore thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will lay stumblingblocks before this people, and the fathers and the sons together shall fall upon them; the neighbour and his friend shall perish.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-006-022" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.006.022"><span class="verse-number">22</span>Thus saith the LORD, Behold, a people cometh from the north country, and a great nation shall be raised from the sides of the earth.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-006-023" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.006.023"><span class="verse-number">23</span>They shall lay hold on bow and spear; they are cruel, and have no mercy; their voice roareth like the sea; and they ride upon horses, set in array as men for war against thee, O daughter of Zion.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-006-024" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.006.024"><span class="verse-number">24</span>We have heard the fame thereof: our hands wax feeble: anguish hath taken hold of us, and pain, as of a woman in travail.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-006-025" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.006.025"><span class="verse-number">25</span>Go not forth into the field, nor walk by the way; for the sword of the enemy and fear is on every side.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-006-026" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.006.026"><span class="verse-number">26</span>O daughter of my people, gird thee with sackcloth, and wallow thyself in ashes: make thee mourning, as for an only son, most bitter lamentation: for the spoiler shall suddenly come upon us.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-006-027" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.006.027"><span class="verse-number">27</span>I have set thee for a tower and a fortress among my people, that thou mayest know and try their way.</p>
