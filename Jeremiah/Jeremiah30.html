            <p class="verse" id="v-24-030-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.030.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>Thus speaketh the LORD God of Israel, saying, Write thee all the words that I have spoken unto thee in a book.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-030-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.030.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>For, lo, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will bring again the captivity of my people Israel and Judah, saith the LORD: and I will cause them to return to the land that I gave to their fathers, and they shall possess it.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-030-004" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.030.004"><span class="verse-number">4</span>And these are the words that the LORD spake concerning Israel and concerning Judah.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-030-005" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.030.005"><span class="verse-number">5</span>For thus saith the LORD; We have heard a voice of trembling, of fear, and not of peace.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-030-006" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.030.006"><span class="verse-number">6</span>Ask ye now, and see whether a man doth travail with child? wherefore do I see every man with his hands on his loins, as a woman in travail, and all faces are turned into paleness?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-030-007" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.030.007"><span class="verse-number">7</span>Alas! for that day is great, so that none is like it: it is even the time of Jacob's trouble; but he shall be saved out of it.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-030-008" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.030.008"><span class="verse-number">8</span>For it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD of hosts, that I will break his yoke from off thy neck, and will burst thy bonds, and strangers shall no more serve themselves of him:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-030-009" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.030.009"><span class="verse-number">9</span>But they shall serve the LORD their God, and David their king, whom I will raise up unto them.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-030-010" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.030.010"><span class="verse-number">10</span>Therefore fear thou not, O my servant Jacob, saith the LORD; neither be dismayed, O Israel: for, lo, I will save thee from afar, and thy seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and shall be in rest, and be quiet, and none shall make him afraid.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-030-011" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.030.011"><span class="verse-number">11</span>For I am with thee, saith the LORD, to save thee: though I make a full end of all nations whither I have scattered thee, yet will I not make a full end of thee: but I will correct thee in measure, and will not leave thee altogether unpunished.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-030-012" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.030.012"><span class="verse-number">12</span>For thus saith the LORD, Thy bruise is incurable, and thy wound is grievous.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-24-030-014" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.030.014"><span class="verse-number">14</span>All thy lovers have forgotten thee; they seek thee not; for I have wounded thee with the wound of an enemy, with the chastisement of a cruel one, for the multitude of thine iniquity; because thy sins were increased.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-030-015" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.030.015"><span class="verse-number">15</span>Why criest thou for thine affliction? thy sorrow is incurable for the multitude of thine iniquity: because thy sins were increased, I have done these things unto thee.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-030-016" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.030.016"><span class="verse-number">16</span>Therefore all they that devour thee shall be devoured; and all thine adversaries, every one of them, shall go into captivity; and they that spoil thee shall be a spoil, and all that prey upon thee will I give for a prey.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-030-017" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.030.017"><span class="verse-number">17</span>For I will restore health unto thee, and I will heal thee of thy wounds, saith the LORD; because they called thee an Outcast, saying, This is Zion, whom no man seeketh after.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-030-018" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.030.018"><span class="verse-number">18</span>Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will bring again the captivity of Jacob's tents, and have mercy on his dwellingplaces; and the city shall be builded upon her own heap, and the palace shall remain after the manner thereof.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-030-019" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.030.019"><span class="verse-number">19</span>And out of them shall proceed thanksgiving and the voice of them that make merry: and I will multiply them, and they shall not be few; I will also glorify them, and they shall not be small.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-030-020" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.030.020"><span class="verse-number">20</span>Their children also shall be as aforetime, and their congregation shall be established before me, and I will punish all that oppress them.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-030-021" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.030.021"><span class="verse-number">21</span>And their nobles shall be of themselves, and their governor shall proceed from the midst of them; and I will cause him to draw near, and he shall approach unto me: for who is this that engaged his heart to approach unto me? saith the LORD.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-030-022" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.030.022"><span class="verse-number">22</span>And ye shall be my people, and I will be your God.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-030-023" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.030.023"><span class="verse-number">23</span>Behold, the whirlwind of the LORD goeth forth with fury, a continuing whirlwind: it shall fall with pain upon the head of the wicked.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-030-024" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.030.024"><span class="verse-number">24</span>The fierce anger of the LORD shall not return, until he have done it, and until he have performed the intents of his heart: in the latter days ye shall consider it.</p>
