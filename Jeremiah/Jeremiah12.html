            <p class="verse" id="v-24-012-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.012.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>Thou hast planted them, yea, they have taken root: they grow, yea, they bring forth fruit: thou art near in their mouth, and far from their reins.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-012-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.012.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>But thou, O LORD, knowest me: thou hast seen me, and tried mine heart toward thee: pull them out like sheep for the slaughter, and prepare them for the day of slaughter.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-012-004" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.012.004"><span class="verse-number">4</span>How long shall the land mourn, and the herbs of every field wither, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein? the beasts are consumed, and the birds; because they said, He shall not see our last end.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-012-005" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.012.005"><span class="verse-number">5</span>If thou hast run with the footmen, and they have wearied thee, then how canst thou contend with horses? and if in the land of peace, wherein thou trustedst, they wearied thee, then how wilt thou do in the swelling of Jordan?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-012-006" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.012.006"><span class="verse-number">6</span>For even thy brethren, and the house of thy father, even they have dealt treacherously with thee; yea, they have called a multitude after thee: believe them not, though they speak fair words unto thee.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-012-007" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.012.007"><span class="verse-number">7</span>I have forsaken mine house, I have left mine heritage; I have given the dearly beloved of my soul into the hand of her enemies.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-24-012-012" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.012.012"><span class="verse-number">12</span>The spoilers are come upon all high places through the wilderness: for the sword of the LORD shall devour from the one end of the land even to the other end of the land: no flesh shall have peace.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-012-013" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.012.013"><span class="verse-number">13</span>They have sown wheat, but shall reap thorns: they have put themselves to pain, but shall not profit: and they shall be ashamed of your revenues because of the fierce anger of the LORD.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-012-014" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.012.014"><span class="verse-number">14</span>Thus saith the LORD against all mine evil neighbours, that touch the inheritance which I have caused my people Israel to inherit; Behold, I will pluck them out of their land, and pluck out the house of Judah from among them.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-24-012-015" data-verse-ref="KJV.24.012.015"><span class="verse-number">15</span>And it shall come to pass, after that I have plucked them out I will return, and have compassion on them, and will bring them again, every man to his heritage, and every man to his land.</p>
