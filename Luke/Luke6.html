            <p class="verse" id="v-42-006-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.006.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>And certain of the Pharisees said unto them, Why do ye that which is not lawful to do on the sabbath days?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-006-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.006.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>And Jesus answering them said, Have ye not read so much as this, what David did, when himself was an hungred, and they which were with him;</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-006-004" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.006.004"><span class="verse-number">4</span>How he went into the house of God, and did take and eat the shewbread, and gave also to them that were with him; which it is not lawful to eat but for the priests alone?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-006-005" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.006.005"><span class="verse-number">5</span>And he said unto them, That the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.</p>
