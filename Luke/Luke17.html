            <p class="verse" id="v-42-017-024" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.017.024"><span class="verse-number">24</span>For as the lightning, that lighteneth out of the one part under heaven, shineth unto the other part under heaven; so shall also the Son of man be in his day.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-017-025" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.017.025"><span class="verse-number">25</span>But first must he suffer many things, and be rejected of this generation.</p>
