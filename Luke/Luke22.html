            <p class="verse" id="v-42-022-052" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.022.052"><span class="verse-number">52</span>Then Jesus said unto the chief priests, and captains of the temple, and the elders, which were come to him, Be ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and staves?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-022-053" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.022.053"><span class="verse-number">53</span>When I was daily with you in the temple, ye stretched forth no hands against me: but this is your hour, and the power of darkness.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-022-054" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.022.054"><span class="verse-number">54</span>Then took they him, and led him, and brought him into the high priest's house. And Peter followed afar off.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-022-055" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.022.055"><span class="verse-number">55</span>And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall, and were set down together, Peter sat down among them.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-022-056" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.022.056"><span class="verse-number">56</span>But a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire, and earnestly looked upon him, and said, This man was also with him.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-022-057" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.022.057"><span class="verse-number">57</span>And he denied him, saying, Woman, I know him not.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-022-058" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.022.058"><span class="verse-number">58</span>And after a little while another saw him, and said, Thou art also of them. And Peter said, Man, I am not.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-022-059" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.022.059"><span class="verse-number">59</span>And about the space of one hour after another confidently affirmed, saying, Of a truth this fellow also was with him: for he is a Galilaean.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-022-060" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.022.060"><span class="verse-number">60</span>And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And immediately, while he yet spake, the cock crew.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-022-061" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.022.061"><span class="verse-number">61</span>And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-022-062" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.022.062"><span class="verse-number">62</span>And Peter went out, and wept bitterly.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-022-063" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.022.063"><span class="verse-number">63</span>And the men that held Jesus mocked him, and smote him.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-022-064" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.022.064"><span class="verse-number">64</span>And when they had blindfolded him, they struck him on the face, and asked him, saying, Prophesy, who is it that smote thee?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-022-065" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.022.065"><span class="verse-number">65</span>And many other things blasphemously spake they against him.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-022-066" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.022.066"><span class="verse-number">66</span>And as soon as it was day, the elders of the people and the chief priests and the scribes came together, and led him into their council, saying,</p>
