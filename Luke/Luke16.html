            <p class="verse" id="v-42-016-001" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.016.001"><span class="verse-number">1</span>And he said also unto his disciples, There was a certain rich man, which had a steward; and the same was accused unto him that he had wasted his goods.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-016-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.016.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>And he called him, and said unto him, How is it that I hear this of thee? give an account of thy stewardship; for thou mayest be no longer steward.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-016-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.016.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>Then the steward said within himself, What shall I do? for my lord taketh away from me the stewardship: I cannot dig; to beg I am ashamed.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-016-004" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.016.004"><span class="verse-number">4</span>I am resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-016-005" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.016.005"><span class="verse-number">5</span>So he called every one of his lord's debtors unto him, and said unto the first, How much owest thou unto my lord?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-016-006" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.016.006"><span class="verse-number">6</span>And he said, An hundred measures of oil. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and sit down quickly, and write fifty.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-016-007" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.016.007"><span class="verse-number">7</span>Then said he to another, And how much owest thou? And he said, An hundred measures of wheat. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and write fourscore.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-016-008" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.016.008"><span class="verse-number">8</span>And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done wisely: for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-016-009" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.016.009"><span class="verse-number">9</span>And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when ye fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-016-010" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.016.010"><span class="verse-number">10</span>He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much: and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-42-016-022" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.016.022"><span class="verse-number">22</span>And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried;</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-016-023" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.016.023"><span class="verse-number">23</span>And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-016-024" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.016.024"><span class="verse-number">24</span>And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-016-025" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.016.025"><span class="verse-number">25</span>But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-016-026" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.016.026"><span class="verse-number">26</span>And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot; neither can they pass to us, that would come from thence.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-016-027" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.016.027"><span class="verse-number">27</span>Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father's house:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-016-028" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.016.028"><span class="verse-number">28</span>For I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment.</p>
