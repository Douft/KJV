            <p class="verse" id="v-42-010-023" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.010.023"><span class="verse-number">23</span>And he turned him unto his disciples, and said privately, Blessed are the eyes which see the things that ye see:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-010-024" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.010.024"><span class="verse-number">24</span>For I tell you, that many prophets and kings have desired to see those things which ye see, and have not seen them; and to hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard them.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-010-025" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.010.025"><span class="verse-number">25</span>And, behold, a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted him, saying, Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-010-026" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.010.026"><span class="verse-number">26</span>He said unto him, What is written in the law? how readest thou?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-010-027" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.010.027"><span class="verse-number">27</span>And he answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbour as thyself.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-010-028" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.010.028"><span class="verse-number">28</span>And he said unto him, Thou hast answered right: this do, and thou shalt live.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-010-029" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.010.029"><span class="verse-number">29</span>But he, willing to justify himself, said unto Jesus, And who is my neighbour?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-010-030" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.010.030"><span class="verse-number">30</span>And Jesus answering said, A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves, which stripped him of his raiment, and wounded him, and departed, leaving him half dead.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-010-031" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.010.031"><span class="verse-number">31</span>And by chance there came down a certain priest that way: and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-010-032" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.010.032"><span class="verse-number">32</span>And likewise a Levite, when he was at the place, came and looked on him, and passed by on the other side.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-010-033" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.010.033"><span class="verse-number">33</span>But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was: and when he saw him, he had compassion on him,</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-010-034" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.010.034"><span class="verse-number">34</span>And went to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-010-035" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.010.035"><span class="verse-number">35</span>And on the morrow when he departed, he took out two pence, and gave them to the host, and said unto him, Take care of him; and whatsoever thou spendest more, when I come again, I will repay thee.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-010-036" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.010.036"><span class="verse-number">36</span>Which now of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbour unto him that fell among the thieves?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-010-037" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.010.037"><span class="verse-number">37</span>And he said, He that shewed mercy on him. Then said Jesus unto him, Go, and do thou likewise.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-010-038" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.010.038"><span class="verse-number">38</span>Now it came to pass, as they went, that he entered into a certain village: and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-010-039" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.010.039"><span class="verse-number">39</span>And she had a sister called Mary, which also sat at Jesus' feet, and heard his word.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-010-040" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.010.040"><span class="verse-number">40</span>But Martha was cumbered about much serving, and came to him, and said, Lord, dost thou not care that my sister hath left me to serve alone? bid her therefore that she help me.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-010-041" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.010.041"><span class="verse-number">41</span>And Jesus answered and said unto her, Martha, Martha, thou art careful and troubled about many things:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-010-042" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.010.042"><span class="verse-number">42</span>But one thing is needful: and Mary hath chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away from her.</p>
