            <p class="verse" id="v-42-024-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.024.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-024-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.024.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-024-004" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.024.004"><span class="verse-number">4</span>And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-024-005" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.024.005"><span class="verse-number">5</span>And as they were afraid, and bowed down their faces to the earth, they said unto them, Why seek ye the living among the dead?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-024-006" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.024.006"><span class="verse-number">6</span>He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee,</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-024-007" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.024.007"><span class="verse-number">7</span>Saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-024-008" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.024.008"><span class="verse-number">8</span>And they remembered his words,</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-024-009" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.024.009"><span class="verse-number">9</span>And returned from the sepulchre, and told all these things unto the eleven, and to all the rest.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-024-010" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.024.010"><span class="verse-number">10</span>It was Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary the mother of James, and other women that were with them, which told these things unto the apostles.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-024-011" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.024.011"><span class="verse-number">11</span>And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed them not.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-42-024-014" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.024.014"><span class="verse-number">14</span>And they talked together of all these things which had happened.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-024-015" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.024.015"><span class="verse-number">15</span>And it came to pass, that, while they communed together and reasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went with them.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-024-016" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.024.016"><span class="verse-number">16</span>But their eyes were holden that they should not know him.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-42-024-018" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.024.018"><span class="verse-number">18</span>And the one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said unto him, Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things which are come to pass there in these days?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-024-019" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.024.019"><span class="verse-number">19</span>And he said unto them, What things? And they said unto him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-024-020" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.024.020"><span class="verse-number">20</span>And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and have crucified him.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-024-021" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.024.021"><span class="verse-number">21</span>But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel: and beside all this, to day is the third day since these things were done.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-024-022" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.024.022"><span class="verse-number">22</span>Yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished, which were early at the sepulchre;</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-024-023" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.024.023"><span class="verse-number">23</span>And when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, which said that he was alive.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-024-024" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.024.024"><span class="verse-number">24</span>And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre, and found it even so as the women had said: but him they saw not.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-024-025" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.024.025"><span class="verse-number">25</span>Then he said unto them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-024-026" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.024.026"><span class="verse-number">26</span>Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-024-027" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.024.027"><span class="verse-number">27</span>And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-024-028" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.024.028"><span class="verse-number">28</span>And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and he made as though he would have gone further.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-024-029" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.024.029"><span class="verse-number">29</span>But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with them.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-024-030" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.024.030"><span class="verse-number">30</span>And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, and blessed it, and brake, and gave to them.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-024-031" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.024.031"><span class="verse-number">31</span>And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-024-032" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.024.032"><span class="verse-number">32</span>And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-024-033" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.024.033"><span class="verse-number">33</span>And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them,</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-024-034" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.024.034"><span class="verse-number">34</span>Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-024-035" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.024.035"><span class="verse-number">35</span>And they told what things were done in the way, and how he was known of them in breaking of bread.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-024-036" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.024.036"><span class="verse-number">36</span>And as they thus spake, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-024-037" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.024.037"><span class="verse-number">37</span>But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a spirit.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-024-038" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.024.038"><span class="verse-number">38</span>And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-024-039" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.024.039"><span class="verse-number">39</span>Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-024-040" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.024.040"><span class="verse-number">40</span>And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them his hands and his feet.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-024-041" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.024.041"><span class="verse-number">41</span>And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said unto them, Have ye here any meat?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-024-042" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.024.042"><span class="verse-number">42</span>And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-024-043" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.024.043"><span class="verse-number">43</span>And he took it, and did eat before them.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-024-044" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.024.044"><span class="verse-number">44</span>And he said unto them, These are the words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-024-045" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.024.045"><span class="verse-number">45</span>Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures,</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-024-046" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.024.046"><span class="verse-number">46</span>And said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-024-047" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.024.047"><span class="verse-number">47</span>And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-024-048" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.024.048"><span class="verse-number">48</span>And ye are witnesses of these things.</p>
