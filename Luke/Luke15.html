            <p class="verse" id="v-42-015-023" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.015.023"><span class="verse-number">23</span>And bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it; and let us eat, and be merry:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-015-024" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.015.024"><span class="verse-number">24</span>For this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found. And they began to be merry.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-42-015-026" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.015.026"><span class="verse-number">26</span>And he called one of the servants, and asked what these things meant.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-015-027" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.015.027"><span class="verse-number">27</span>And he said unto him, Thy brother is come; and thy father hath killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him safe and sound.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-015-028" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.015.028"><span class="verse-number">28</span>And he was angry, and would not go in: therefore came his father out, and intreated him.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-015-029" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.015.029"><span class="verse-number">29</span>And he answering said to his father, Lo, these many years do I serve thee, neither transgressed I at any time thy commandment: and yet thou never gavest me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-015-030" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.015.030"><span class="verse-number">30</span>But as soon as this thy son was come, which hath devoured thy living with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-015-031" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.015.031"><span class="verse-number">31</span>And he said unto him, Son, thou art ever with me, and all that I have is thine.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-015-032" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.015.032"><span class="verse-number">32</span>It was meet that we should make merry, and be glad: for this thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is found.</p>
