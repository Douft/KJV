            <p class="verse" id="v-42-001-023" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.001.023"><span class="verse-number">23</span>And it came to pass, that, as soon as the days of his ministration were accomplished, he departed to his own house.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-42-001-029" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.001.029"><span class="verse-number">29</span>And when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be.</p>
