            <p class="verse" id="v-42-019-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.019.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>And he sought to see Jesus who he was; and could not for the press, because he was little of stature.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-019-004" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.019.004"><span class="verse-number">4</span>And he ran before, and climbed up into a sycomore tree to see him: for he was to pass that way.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-019-005" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.019.005"><span class="verse-number">5</span>And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up, and saw him, and said unto him, Zacchaeus, make haste, and come down; for to day I must abide at thy house.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-019-006" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.019.006"><span class="verse-number">6</span>And he made haste, and came down, and received him joyfully.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-019-007" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.019.007"><span class="verse-number">7</span>And when they saw it, they all murmured, saying, That he was gone to be guest with a man that is a sinner.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-019-008" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.019.008"><span class="verse-number">8</span>And Zacchaeus stood, and said unto the Lord; Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken any thing from any man by false accusation, I restore him fourfold.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-019-009" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.019.009"><span class="verse-number">9</span>And Jesus said unto him, This day is salvation come to this house, forsomuch as he also is a son of Abraham.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-019-010" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.019.010"><span class="verse-number">10</span>For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-42-019-016" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.019.016"><span class="verse-number">16</span>Then came the first, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained ten pounds.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-019-017" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.019.017"><span class="verse-number">17</span>And he said unto him, Well, thou good servant: because thou hast been faithful in a very little, have thou authority over ten cities.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-019-018" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.019.018"><span class="verse-number">18</span>And the second came, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained five pounds.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-42-019-021" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.019.021"><span class="verse-number">21</span>For I feared thee, because thou art an austere man: thou takest up that thou layedst not down, and reapest that thou didst not sow.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-019-022" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.019.022"><span class="verse-number">22</span>And he saith unto him, Out of thine own mouth will I judge thee, thou wicked servant. Thou knewest that I was an austere man, taking up that I laid not down, and reaping that I did not sow:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-019-023" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.019.023"><span class="verse-number">23</span>Wherefore then gavest not thou my money into the bank, that at my coming I might have required mine own with usury?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-019-024" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.019.024"><span class="verse-number">24</span>And he said unto them that stood by, Take from him the pound, and give it to him that hath ten pounds.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-019-025" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.019.025"><span class="verse-number">25</span>(And they said unto him, Lord, he hath ten pounds.)</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-019-026" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.019.026"><span class="verse-number">26</span>For I say unto you, That unto every one which hath shall be given; and from him that hath not, even that he hath shall be taken away from him.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-019-027" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.019.027"><span class="verse-number">27</span>But those mine enemies, which would not that I should reign over them, bring hither, and slay them before me.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-019-028" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.019.028"><span class="verse-number">28</span>And when he had thus spoken, he went before, ascending up to Jerusalem.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-019-029" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.019.029"><span class="verse-number">29</span>And it came to pass, when he was come nigh to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount called the mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples,</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-019-030" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.019.030"><span class="verse-number">30</span>Saying, Go ye into the village over against you; in the which at your entering ye shall find a colt tied, whereon yet never man sat: loose him, and bring him hither.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-019-031" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.019.031"><span class="verse-number">31</span>And if any man ask you, Why do ye loose him? thus shall ye say unto him, Because the Lord hath need of him.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-019-032" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.019.032"><span class="verse-number">32</span>And they that were sent went their way, and found even as he had said unto them.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-019-033" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.019.033"><span class="verse-number">33</span>And as they were loosing the colt, the owners thereof said unto them, Why loose ye the colt?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-019-034" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.019.034"><span class="verse-number">34</span>And they said, The Lord hath need of him.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-019-035" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.019.035"><span class="verse-number">35</span>And they brought him to Jesus: and they cast their garments upon the colt, and they set Jesus thereon.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-019-036" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.019.036"><span class="verse-number">36</span>And as he went, they spread their clothes in the way.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-019-037" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.019.037"><span class="verse-number">37</span>And when he was come nigh, even now at the descent of the mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen;</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-019-038" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.019.038"><span class="verse-number">38</span>Saying, Blessed be the King that cometh in the name of the Lord: peace in heaven, and glory in the highest.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-019-039" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.019.039"><span class="verse-number">39</span>And some of the Pharisees from among the multitude said unto him, Master, rebuke thy disciples.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-019-040" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.019.040"><span class="verse-number">40</span>And he answered and said unto them, I tell you that, if these should hold their peace, the stones would immediately cry out.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-019-041" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.019.041"><span class="verse-number">41</span>And when he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept over it,</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-019-042" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.019.042"><span class="verse-number">42</span>Saying, If thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy day, the things which belong unto thy peace! but now they are hid from thine eyes.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-019-043" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.019.043"><span class="verse-number">43</span>For the days shall come upon thee, that thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee, and compass thee round, and keep thee in on every side,</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-019-044" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.019.044"><span class="verse-number">44</span>And shall lay thee even with the ground, and thy children within thee; and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another; because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-019-045" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.019.045"><span class="verse-number">45</span>And he went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold therein, and them that bought;</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-019-046" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.019.046"><span class="verse-number">46</span>Saying unto them, It is written, My house is the house of prayer: but ye have made it a den of thieves.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-019-047" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.019.047"><span class="verse-number">47</span>And he taught daily in the temple. But the chief priests and the scribes and the chief of the people sought to destroy him,</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-019-048" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.019.048"><span class="verse-number">48</span>And could not find what they might do: for all the people were very attentive to hear him.</p>
