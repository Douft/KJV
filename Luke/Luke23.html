            <p class="verse" id="v-42-023-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.023.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this fellow perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, saying that he himself is Christ a King.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-023-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.023.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answered him and said, Thou sayest it.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-023-004" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.023.004"><span class="verse-number">4</span>Then said Pilate to the chief priests and to the people, I find no fault in this man.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-023-005" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.023.005"><span class="verse-number">5</span>And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee to this place.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-023-006" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.023.006"><span class="verse-number">6</span>When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a Galilaean.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-023-007" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.023.007"><span class="verse-number">7</span>And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem at that time.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-023-008" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.023.008"><span class="verse-number">8</span>And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was desirous to see him of a long season, because he had heard many things of him; and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-023-009" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.023.009"><span class="verse-number">9</span>Then he questioned with him in many words; but he answered him nothing.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-023-010" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.023.010"><span class="verse-number">10</span>And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-023-011" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.023.011"><span class="verse-number">11</span>And Herod with his men of war set him at nought, and mocked him, and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to Pilate.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-42-023-017" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.023.017"><span class="verse-number">17</span>(For of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast.)</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-023-018" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.023.018"><span class="verse-number">18</span>And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this man, and release unto us Barabbas:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-023-019" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.023.019"><span class="verse-number">19</span>(Who for a certain sedition made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.)</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-42-023-021" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.023.021"><span class="verse-number">21</span>But they cried, saying, Crucify him, crucify him.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-023-022" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.023.022"><span class="verse-number">22</span>And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath he done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him, and let him go.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-023-023" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.023.023"><span class="verse-number">23</span>And they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified. And the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-023-024" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.023.024"><span class="verse-number">24</span>And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-023-025" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.023.025"><span class="verse-number">25</span>And he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered Jesus to their will.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-023-026" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.023.026"><span class="verse-number">26</span>And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might bear it after Jesus.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-023-027" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.023.027"><span class="verse-number">27</span>And there followed him a great company of people, and of women, which also bewailed and lamented him.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-023-028" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.023.028"><span class="verse-number">28</span>But Jesus turning unto them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-023-029" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.023.029"><span class="verse-number">29</span>For, behold, the days are coming, in the which they shall say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and the paps which never gave suck.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-023-030" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.023.030"><span class="verse-number">30</span>Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-023-031" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.023.031"><span class="verse-number">31</span>For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in the dry?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-023-032" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.023.032"><span class="verse-number">32</span>And there were also two other, malefactors, led with him to be put to death.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-023-033" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.023.033"><span class="verse-number">33</span>And when they were come to the place, which is called Calvary, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand, and the other on the left.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-023-034" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.023.034"><span class="verse-number">34</span>Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. And they parted his raiment, and cast lots.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-023-035" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.023.035"><span class="verse-number">35</span>And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them derided him, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if he be Christ, the chosen of God.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-023-036" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.023.036"><span class="verse-number">36</span>And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering him vinegar,</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-023-037" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.023.037"><span class="verse-number">37</span>And saying, If thou be the king of the Jews, save thyself.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-023-038" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.023.038"><span class="verse-number">38</span>And a superscription also was written over him in letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-023-039" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.023.039"><span class="verse-number">39</span>And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him, saying, If thou be Christ, save thyself and us.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-023-040" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.023.040"><span class="verse-number">40</span>But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-023-041" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.023.041"><span class="verse-number">41</span>And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-023-042" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.023.042"><span class="verse-number">42</span>And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-023-043" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.023.043"><span class="verse-number">43</span>And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in paradise.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-023-044" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.023.044"><span class="verse-number">44</span>And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-023-045" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.023.045"><span class="verse-number">45</span>And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-023-046" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.023.046"><span class="verse-number">46</span>And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said thus, he gave up the ghost.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-023-047" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.023.047"><span class="verse-number">47</span>Now when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-023-048" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.023.048"><span class="verse-number">48</span>And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding the things which were done, smote their breasts, and returned.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-023-049" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.023.049"><span class="verse-number">49</span>And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed him from Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-023-050" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.023.050"><span class="verse-number">50</span>And, behold, there was a man named Joseph, a counseller; and he was a good man, and a just:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-023-051" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.023.051"><span class="verse-number">51</span>(The same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them;) he was of Arimathaea, a city of the Jews: who also himself waited for the kingdom of God.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-023-052" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.023.052"><span class="verse-number">52</span>This man went unto Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-023-053" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.023.053"><span class="verse-number">53</span>And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a sepulchre that was hewn in stone, wherein never man before was laid.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-42-023-054" data-verse-ref="KJV.42.023.054"><span class="verse-number">54</span>And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on.</p>
