            <p class="verse" id="v-11-016-022" data-verse-ref="KJV.11.016.022"><span class="verse-number">22</span>But the people that followed Omri prevailed against the people that followed Tibni the son of Ginath: so Tibni died, and Omri reigned.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-11-016-023" data-verse-ref="KJV.11.016.023"><span class="verse-number">23</span>In the thirty and first year of Asa king of Judah began Omri to reign over Israel, twelve years: six years reigned he in Tirzah.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-11-016-025" data-verse-ref="KJV.11.016.025"><span class="verse-number">25</span>But Omri wrought evil in the eyes of the LORD, and did worse than all that were before him.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-11-016-026" data-verse-ref="KJV.11.016.026"><span class="verse-number">26</span>For he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin, to provoke the LORD God of Israel to anger with their vanities.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-11-016-027" data-verse-ref="KJV.11.016.027"><span class="verse-number">27</span>Now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did, and his might that he shewed, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-11-016-030" data-verse-ref="KJV.11.016.030"><span class="verse-number">30</span>And Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the sight of the LORD above all that were before him.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-11-016-031" data-verse-ref="KJV.11.016.031"><span class="verse-number">31</span>And it came to pass, as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, that he took to wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Zidonians, and went and served Baal, and worshipped him.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-11-016-032" data-verse-ref="KJV.11.016.032"><span class="verse-number">32</span>And he reared up an altar for Baal in the house of Baal, which he had built in Samaria.</p>
