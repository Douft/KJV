            <p class="verse" id="v-11-005-006" data-verse-ref="KJV.11.005.006"><span class="verse-number">6</span>Now therefore command thou that they hew me cedar trees out of Lebanon; and my servants shall be with thy servants: and unto thee will I give hire for thy servants according to all that thou shalt appoint: for thou knowest that there is not among us any that can skill to hew timber like unto the Sidonians.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-11-005-007" data-verse-ref="KJV.11.005.007"><span class="verse-number">7</span>And it came to pass, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon, that he rejoiced greatly, and said, Blessed be the LORD this day, which hath given unto David a wise son over this great people.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-11-005-008" data-verse-ref="KJV.11.005.008"><span class="verse-number">8</span>And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, I have considered the things which thou sentest to me for: and I will do all thy desire concerning timber of cedar, and concerning timber of fir.</p>
