            <p class="verse" id="v-11-001-046" data-verse-ref="KJV.11.001.046"><span class="verse-number">46</span>And also Solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-11-001-047" data-verse-ref="KJV.11.001.047"><span class="verse-number">47</span>And moreover the king's servants came to bless our lord king David, saying, God make the name of Solomon better than thy name, and make his throne greater than thy throne. And the king bowed himself upon the bed.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-11-001-048" data-verse-ref="KJV.11.001.048"><span class="verse-number">48</span>And also thus said the king, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, which hath given one to sit on my throne this day, mine eyes even seeing it.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-11-001-049" data-verse-ref="KJV.11.001.049"><span class="verse-number">49</span>And all the guests that were with Adonijah were afraid, and rose up, and went every man his way.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-11-001-050" data-verse-ref="KJV.11.001.050"><span class="verse-number">50</span>And Adonijah feared because of Solomon, and arose, and went, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-11-001-051" data-verse-ref="KJV.11.001.051"><span class="verse-number">51</span>And it was told Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah feareth king Solomon: for, lo, he hath caught hold on the horns of the altar, saying, Let king Solomon swear unto me to day that he will not slay his servant with the sword.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-11-001-052" data-verse-ref="KJV.11.001.052"><span class="verse-number">52</span>And Solomon said, If he will shew himself a worthy man, there shall not an hair of him fall to the earth: but if wickedness shall be found in him, he shall die.</p>
