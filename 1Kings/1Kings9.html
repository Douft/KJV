            <p class="verse" id="v-11-009-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.11.009.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>That the LORD appeared to Solomon the second time, as he had appeared unto him at Gibeon.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-11-009-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.11.009.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>And the LORD said unto him, I have heard thy prayer and thy supplication, that thou hast made before me: I have hallowed this house, which thou hast built, to put my name there for ever; and mine eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-11-009-004" data-verse-ref="KJV.11.009.004"><span class="verse-number">4</span>And if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy father walked, in integrity of heart, and in uprightness, to do according to all that I have commanded thee, and wilt keep my statutes and my judgments:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-11-009-005" data-verse-ref="KJV.11.009.005"><span class="verse-number">5</span>Then I will establish the throne of thy kingdom upon Israel for ever, as I promised to David thy father, saying, There shall not fail thee a man upon the throne of Israel.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-11-009-006" data-verse-ref="KJV.11.009.006"><span class="verse-number">6</span>But if ye shall at all turn from following me, ye or your children, and will not keep my commandments and my statutes which I have set before you, but go and serve other gods, and worship them:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-11-009-007" data-verse-ref="KJV.11.009.007"><span class="verse-number">7</span>Then will I cut off Israel out of the land which I have given them; and this house, which I have hallowed for my name, will I cast out of my sight; and Israel shall be a proverb and a byword among all people:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-11-009-008" data-verse-ref="KJV.11.009.008"><span class="verse-number">8</span>And at this house, which is high, every one that passeth by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss; and they shall say, Why hath the LORD done thus unto this land, and to this house?</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-11-009-021" data-verse-ref="KJV.11.009.021"><span class="verse-number">21</span>Their children that were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel also were not able utterly to destroy, upon those did Solomon levy a tribute of bondservice unto this day.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-11-009-022" data-verse-ref="KJV.11.009.022"><span class="verse-number">22</span>But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no bondmen: but they were men of war, and his servants, and his princes, and his captains, and rulers of his chariots, and his horsemen.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-11-009-023" data-verse-ref="KJV.11.009.023"><span class="verse-number">23</span>These were the chief of the officers that were over Solomon's work, five hundred and fifty, which bare rule over the people that wrought in the work.</p>
