            <p class="verse" id="v-11-022-013" data-verse-ref="KJV.11.022.013"><span class="verse-number">13</span>And the messenger that was gone to call Micaiah spake unto him, saying, Behold now, the words of the prophets declare good unto the king with one mouth: let thy word, I pray thee, be like the word of one of them, and speak that which is good.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-11-022-014" data-verse-ref="KJV.11.022.014"><span class="verse-number">14</span>And Micaiah said, As the LORD liveth, what the LORD saith unto me, that will I speak.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-11-022-020" data-verse-ref="KJV.11.022.020"><span class="verse-number">20</span>And the LORD said, Who shall persuade Ahab, that he may go up and fall at Ramothgilead? And one said on this manner, and another said on that manner.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-11-022-021" data-verse-ref="KJV.11.022.021"><span class="verse-number">21</span>And there came forth a spirit, and stood before the LORD, and said, I will persuade him.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-11-022-022" data-verse-ref="KJV.11.022.022"><span class="verse-number">22</span>And the LORD said unto him, Wherewith? And he said, I will go forth, and I will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And he said, Thou shalt persuade him, and prevail also: go forth, and do so.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-11-022-023" data-verse-ref="KJV.11.022.023"><span class="verse-number">23</span>Now therefore, behold, the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these thy prophets, and the LORD hath spoken evil concerning thee.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-11-022-024" data-verse-ref="KJV.11.022.024"><span class="verse-number">24</span>But Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah went near, and smote Micaiah on the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the LORD from me to speak unto thee?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-11-022-025" data-verse-ref="KJV.11.022.025"><span class="verse-number">25</span>And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see in that day, when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-11-022-026" data-verse-ref="KJV.11.022.026"><span class="verse-number">26</span>And the king of Israel said, Take Micaiah, and carry him back unto Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's son;</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-11-022-027" data-verse-ref="KJV.11.022.027"><span class="verse-number">27</span>And say, Thus saith the king, Put this fellow in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I come in peace.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-11-022-028" data-verse-ref="KJV.11.022.028"><span class="verse-number">28</span>And Micaiah said, If thou return at all in peace, the LORD hath not spoken by me. And he said, Hearken, O people, every one of you.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-11-022-029" data-verse-ref="KJV.11.022.029"><span class="verse-number">29</span>So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramothgilead.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-11-022-030" data-verse-ref="KJV.11.022.030"><span class="verse-number">30</span>And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and enter into the battle; but put thou on thy robes. And the king of Israel disguised himself, and went into the battle.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-11-022-031" data-verse-ref="KJV.11.022.031"><span class="verse-number">31</span>But the king of Syria commanded his thirty and two captains that had rule over his chariots, saying, Fight neither with small nor great, save only with the king of Israel.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-11-022-032" data-verse-ref="KJV.11.022.032"><span class="verse-number">32</span>And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, Surely it is the king of Israel.

            <p class="verse" id="v-11-022-033" data-verse-ref="KJV.11.022.033"><span class="verse-number">33</span>And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-11-022-034" data-verse-ref="KJV.11.022.034"><span class="verse-number">34</span>And a certain man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the harness: wherefore he said unto the driver of his chariot, Turn thine hand, and carry me out of the host; for I am wounded.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-11-022-035" data-verse-ref="KJV.11.022.035"><span class="verse-number">35</span>And the battle increased that day: and the king was stayed up in his chariot against the Syrians, and died at even: and the blood ran out of the wound into the midst of the chariot.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-11-022-036" data-verse-ref="KJV.11.022.036"><span class="verse-number">36</span>And there went a proclamation throughout the host about the going down of the sun, saying, Every man to his city, and every man to his own country.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-11-022-037" data-verse-ref="KJV.11.022.037"><span class="verse-number">37</span>So the king died, and was brought to Samaria; and they buried the king in Samaria.</p>
