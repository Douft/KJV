And his mother's name was Naamah an Ammonitess.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-11-014-022" data-verse-ref="KJV.11.014.022"><span class="verse-number">22</span>And Judah did evil in the sight of the LORD, and they provoked him to jealousy with their sins which they had committed, above all that their fathers had done.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-11-014-023" data-verse-ref="KJV.11.014.023"><span class="verse-number">23</span>For they also built them high places, and images, and groves, on every high hill, and under every green tree.</p>
