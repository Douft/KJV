            <p class="verse" id="v-43-009-001" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.009.001"><span class="verse-number">1</span>And as Jesus passed by, he saw a man which was blind from his birth.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-009-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.009.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-009-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.009.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>Jesus answered, Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-009-004" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.009.004"><span class="verse-number">4</span>I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-009-005" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.009.005"><span class="verse-number">5</span>As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-009-006" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.009.006"><span class="verse-number">6</span>When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay,</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-009-007" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.009.007"><span class="verse-number">7</span>And said unto him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, (which is by interpretation, Sent.) He went his way therefore, and washed, and came seeing.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-009-008" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.009.008"><span class="verse-number">8</span>The neighbours therefore, and they which before had seen him that he was blind, said, Is not this he that sat and begged?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-009-009" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.009.009"><span class="verse-number">9</span>Some said, This is he: others said, He is like him: but he said, I am he.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-009-010" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.009.010"><span class="verse-number">10</span>Therefore said they unto him, How were thine eyes opened?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-009-011" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.009.011"><span class="verse-number">11</span>He answered and said, A man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash: and I went and washed, and I received sight.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-009-012" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.009.012"><span class="verse-number">12</span>Then said they unto him, Where is he? He said, I know not.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-009-013" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.009.013"><span class="verse-number">13</span>They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-009-014" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.009.014"><span class="verse-number">14</span>And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-009-015" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.009.015"><span class="verse-number">15</span>Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. He said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and do see.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-009-016" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.009.016"><span class="verse-number">16</span>Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God, because he keepeth not the sabbath day. Others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among them.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-009-017" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.009.017"><span class="verse-number">17</span>They say unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, that he hath opened thine eyes? He said, He is a prophet.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-009-018" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.009.018"><span class="verse-number">18</span>But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-009-019" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.009.019"><span class="verse-number">19</span>And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was born blind? how then doth he now see?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-009-020" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.009.020"><span class="verse-number">20</span>His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-009-021" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.009.021"><span class="verse-number">21</span>But by what means he now seeth, we know not; or who hath opened his eyes, we know not: he is of age; ask him: he shall speak for himself.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-009-022" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.009.022"><span class="verse-number">22</span>These words spake his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man did confess that he was Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-009-023" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.009.023"><span class="verse-number">23</span>Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-009-024" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.009.024"><span class="verse-number">24</span>Then again called they the man that was blind, and said unto him, Give God the praise: we know that this man is a sinner.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-009-025" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.009.025"><span class="verse-number">25</span>He answered and said, Whether he be a sinner or no, I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-009-026" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.009.026"><span class="verse-number">26</span>Then said they to him again, What did he to thee? how opened he thine eyes?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-009-027" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.009.027"><span class="verse-number">27</span>He answered them, I have told you already, and ye did not hear: wherefore would ye hear it again? will ye also be his disciples?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-009-028" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.009.028"><span class="verse-number">28</span>Then they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we are Moses' disciples.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-009-029" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.009.029"><span class="verse-number">29</span>We know that God spake unto Moses: as for this fellow, we know not from whence he is.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-009-030" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.009.030"><span class="verse-number">30</span>The man answered and said unto them, Why herein is a marvellous thing, that ye know not from whence he is, and yet he hath opened mine eyes.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-009-031" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.009.031"><span class="verse-number">31</span>Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and doeth his will, him he heareth.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-009-032" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.009.032"><span class="verse-number">32</span>Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-009-033" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.009.033"><span class="verse-number">33</span>If this man were not of God, he could do nothing.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-009-034" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.009.034"><span class="verse-number">34</span>They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-009-035" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.009.035"><span class="verse-number">35</span>Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said unto him, Dost thou believe on the Son of God?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-009-036" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.009.036"><span class="verse-number">36</span>He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-009-037" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.009.037"><span class="verse-number">37</span>And Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-009-038" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.009.038"><span class="verse-number">38</span>And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-009-039" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.009.039"><span class="verse-number">39</span>And Jesus said, For judgment I am come into this world, that they which see not might see; and that they which see might be made blind.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-009-040" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.009.040"><span class="verse-number">40</span>And some of the Pharisees which were with him heard these words, and said unto him, Are we blind also?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-009-041" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.009.041"><span class="verse-number">41</span>Jesus said unto them, If ye were blind, ye should have no sin: but now ye say, We see; therefore your sin remaineth.</p>
