            <p class="verse" id="v-43-007-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.007.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>Now the Jews' feast of tabernacles was at hand.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-007-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.007.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go into Judaea, that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-007-004" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.007.004"><span class="verse-number">4</span>For there is no man that doeth any thing in secret, and he himself seeketh to be known openly. If thou do these things, shew thyself to the world.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-007-005" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.007.005"><span class="verse-number">5</span>For neither did his brethren believe in him.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-007-006" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.007.006"><span class="verse-number">6</span>Then Jesus said unto them, My time is not yet come: but your time is alway ready.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-007-007" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.007.007"><span class="verse-number">7</span>The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify of it, that the works thereof are evil.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-007-008" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.007.008"><span class="verse-number">8</span>Go ye up unto this feast: I go not up yet unto this feast; for my time is not yet full come.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-007-009" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.007.009"><span class="verse-number">9</span>When he had said these words unto them, he abode still in Galilee.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-007-010" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.007.010"><span class="verse-number">10</span>But when his brethren were gone up, then went he also up unto the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-007-011" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.007.011"><span class="verse-number">11</span>Then the Jews sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-007-012" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.007.012"><span class="verse-number">12</span>And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him: for some said, He is a good man: others said, Nay; but he deceiveth the people.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-007-013" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.007.013"><span class="verse-number">13</span>Howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-007-014" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.007.014"><span class="verse-number">14</span>Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-007-015" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.007.015"><span class="verse-number">15</span>And the Jews marvelled, saying, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-007-016" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.007.016"><span class="verse-number">16</span>Jesus answered them, and said, My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-007-017" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.007.017"><span class="verse-number">17</span>If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-007-018" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.007.018"><span class="verse-number">18</span>He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-007-019" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.007.019"><span class="verse-number">19</span>Did not Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keepeth the law? Why go ye about to kill me?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-007-020" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.007.020"><span class="verse-number">20</span>The people answered and said, Thou hast a devil: who goeth about to kill thee?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-007-021" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.007.021"><span class="verse-number">21</span>Jesus answered and said unto them, I have done one work, and ye all marvel.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-007-022" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.007.022"><span class="verse-number">22</span>Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision; (not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers;) and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a man.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-007-023" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.007.023"><span class="verse-number">23</span>If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision, that the law of Moses should not be broken; are ye angry at me, because I have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-007-024" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.007.024"><span class="verse-number">24</span>Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-007-025" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.007.025"><span class="verse-number">25</span>Then said some of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he, whom they seek to kill?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-007-026" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.007.026"><span class="verse-number">26</span>But, lo, he speaketh boldly, and they say nothing unto him. Do the rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-007-027" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.007.027"><span class="verse-number">27</span>Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when Christ cometh, no man knoweth whence he is.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-007-028" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.007.028"><span class="verse-number">28</span>Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, Ye both know me, and ye know whence I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-007-029" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.007.029"><span class="verse-number">29</span>But I know him: for I am from him, and he hath sent me.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-007-030" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.007.030"><span class="verse-number">30</span>Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-007-031" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.007.031"><span class="verse-number">31</span>And many of the people believed on him, and said, When Christ cometh, will he do more miracles than these which this man hath done?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-007-032" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.007.032"><span class="verse-number">32</span>The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him; and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-007-033" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.007.033"><span class="verse-number">33</span>Then said Jesus unto them, Yet a little while am I with you, and then I go unto him that sent me.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-007-034" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.007.034"><span class="verse-number">34</span>Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-007-035" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.007.035"><span class="verse-number">35</span>Then said the Jews among themselves, Whither will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-007-036" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.007.036"><span class="verse-number">36</span>What manner of saying is this that he said, Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-007-037" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.007.037"><span class="verse-number">37</span>In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-007-038" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.007.038"><span class="verse-number">38</span>He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-007-039" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.007.039"><span class="verse-number">39</span>(But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet given; because that Jesus was not yet glorified.)</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-007-040" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.007.040"><span class="verse-number">40</span>Many of the people therefore, when they heard this saying, said, Of a truth this is the Prophet.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-007-041" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.007.041"><span class="verse-number">41</span>Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, Shall Christ come out of Galilee?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-007-042" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.007.042"><span class="verse-number">42</span>Hath not the scripture said, That Christ cometh of the seed of David, and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David was?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-007-043" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.007.043"><span class="verse-number">43</span>So there was a division among the people because of him.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-007-044" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.007.044"><span class="verse-number">44</span>And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-007-045" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.007.045"><span class="verse-number">45</span>Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said unto them, Why have ye not brought him?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-007-046" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.007.046"><span class="verse-number">46</span>The officers answered, Never man spake like this man.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-007-047" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.007.047"><span class="verse-number">47</span>Then answered them the Pharisees, Are ye also deceived?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-007-048" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.007.048"><span class="verse-number">48</span>Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-007-049" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.007.049"><span class="verse-number">49</span>But this people who knoweth not the law are cursed.</p>
