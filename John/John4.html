            <p class="verse" id="v-43-004-005" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.004.005"><span class="verse-number">5</span>Then cometh he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-004-006" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.004.006"><span class="verse-number">6</span>Now Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus on the well: and it was about the sixth hour.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-004-007" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.004.007"><span class="verse-number">7</span>There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her, Give me to drink.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-43-004-010" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.004.010"><span class="verse-number">10</span>Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-43-004-018" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.004.018"><span class="verse-number">18</span>For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: in that saidst thou truly.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-43-004-022" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.004.022"><span class="verse-number">22</span>Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-004-023" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.004.023"><span class="verse-number">23</span>But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-004-024" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.004.024"><span class="verse-number">24</span>God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-43-004-026" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.004.026"><span class="verse-number">26</span>Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am he.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-004-027" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.004.027"><span class="verse-number">27</span>And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked with the woman: yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why talkest thou with her?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-004-028" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.004.028"><span class="verse-number">28</span>The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men,</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-004-029" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.004.029"><span class="verse-number">29</span>Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-004-030" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.004.030"><span class="verse-number">30</span>Then they went out of the city, and came unto him.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-004-031" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.004.031"><span class="verse-number">31</span>In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-004-032" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.004.032"><span class="verse-number">32</span>But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not of.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-004-033" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.004.033"><span class="verse-number">33</span>Therefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any man brought him ought to eat?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-004-034" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.004.034"><span class="verse-number">34</span>Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-004-035" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.004.035"><span class="verse-number">35</span>Say not ye, There are yet four months, and then cometh harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-004-036" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.004.036"><span class="verse-number">36</span>And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-004-037" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.004.037"><span class="verse-number">37</span>And herein is that saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-004-038" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.004.038"><span class="verse-number">38</span>I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour: other men laboured, and ye are entered into their labours.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-004-039" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.004.039"><span class="verse-number">39</span>And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman, which testified, He told me all that ever I did.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-004-040" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.004.040"><span class="verse-number">40</span>So when the Samaritans were come unto him, they besought him that he would tarry with them: and he abode there two days.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-004-041" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.004.041"><span class="verse-number">41</span>And many more believed because of his own word;</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-004-042" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.004.042"><span class="verse-number">42</span>And said unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy saying: for we have heard him ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-004-043" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.004.043"><span class="verse-number">43</span>Now after two days he departed thence, and went into Galilee.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-004-044" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.004.044"><span class="verse-number">44</span>For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honour in his own country.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-004-045" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.004.045"><span class="verse-number">45</span>Then when he was come into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him, having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went unto the feast.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-004-046" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.004.046"><span class="verse-number">46</span>So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-004-047" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.004.047"><span class="verse-number">47</span>When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he went unto him, and besought him that he would come down, and heal his son: for he was at the point of death.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-004-048" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.004.048"><span class="verse-number">48</span>Then said Jesus unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-004-049" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.004.049"><span class="verse-number">49</span>The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-004-050" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.004.050"><span class="verse-number">50</span>Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him, and he went his way.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-004-051" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.004.051"><span class="verse-number">51</span>And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told him, saying, Thy son liveth.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-004-052" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.004.052"><span class="verse-number">52</span>Then inquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-004-053" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.004.053"><span class="verse-number">53</span>So the father knew that it was at the same hour, in the which Jesus said unto him, Thy son liveth: and himself believed, and his whole house.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-004-054" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.004.054"><span class="verse-number">54</span>This is again the second miracle that Jesus did, when he was come out of Judaea into Galilee.</p>
