            <p class="verse" id="v-43-013-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.013.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>And supper being ended, the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray him;</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-013-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.013.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he was come from God, and went to God;</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-013-004" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.013.004"><span class="verse-number">4</span>He riseth from supper, and laid aside his garments; and took a towel, and girded himself.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-013-005" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.013.005"><span class="verse-number">5</span>After that he poureth water into a bason, and began to wash the disciples' feet, and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-013-006" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.013.006"><span class="verse-number">6</span>Then cometh he to Simon Peter: and Peter saith unto him, Lord, dost thou wash my feet?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-013-007" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.013.007"><span class="verse-number">7</span>Jesus answered and said unto him, What I do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt know hereafter.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-013-008" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.013.008"><span class="verse-number">8</span>Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-013-009" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.013.009"><span class="verse-number">9</span>Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-013-010" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.013.010"><span class="verse-number">10</span>Jesus saith to him, He that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet, but is clean every whit: and ye are clean, but not all.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-013-011" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.013.011"><span class="verse-number">11</span>For he knew who should betray him; therefore said he, Ye are not all clean.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-013-012" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.013.012"><span class="verse-number">12</span>So after he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments, and was set down again, he said unto them, Know ye what I have done to you?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-013-013" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.013.013"><span class="verse-number">13</span>Ye call me Master and Lord: and ye say well; for so I am.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-013-014" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.013.014"><span class="verse-number">14</span>If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; ye also ought to wash one another's feet.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-013-015" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.013.015"><span class="verse-number">15</span>For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done to you.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-013-016" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.013.016"><span class="verse-number">16</span>Verily, verily, I say unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord; neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-013-017" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.013.017"><span class="verse-number">17</span>If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-013-018" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.013.018"><span class="verse-number">18</span>I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the scripture may be fulfilled, He that eateth bread with me hath lifted up his heel against me.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-013-019" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.013.019"><span class="verse-number">19</span>Now I tell you before it come, that, when it is come to pass, ye may believe that I am he.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-013-020" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.013.020"><span class="verse-number">20</span>Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that receiveth whomsoever I send receiveth me; and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-013-021" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.013.021"><span class="verse-number">21</span>When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in spirit, and testified, and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-013-022" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.013.022"><span class="verse-number">22</span>Then the disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom he spake.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-013-023" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.013.023"><span class="verse-number">23</span>Now there was leaning on Jesus' bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-013-024" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.013.024"><span class="verse-number">24</span>Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him, that he should ask who it should be of whom he spake.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-013-025" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.013.025"><span class="verse-number">25</span>He then lying on Jesus' breast saith unto him, Lord, who is it?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-013-026" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.013.026"><span class="verse-number">26</span>Jesus answered, He it is, to whom I shall give a sop, when I have dipped it. And when he had dipped the sop, he gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-013-027" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.013.027"><span class="verse-number">27</span>And after the sop Satan entered into him. Then said Jesus unto him, That thou doest, do quickly.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-013-028" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.013.028"><span class="verse-number">28</span>Now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this unto him.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-013-029" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.013.029"><span class="verse-number">29</span>For some of them thought, because Judas had the bag, that Jesus had said unto him, Buy those things that we have need of against the feast; or, that he should give something to the poor.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-013-030" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.013.030"><span class="verse-number">30</span>He then having received the sop went immediately out: and it was night.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-013-031" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.013.031"><span class="verse-number">31</span>Therefore, when he was gone out, Jesus said, Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-013-032" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.013.032"><span class="verse-number">32</span>If God be glorified in him, God shall also glorify him in himself, and shall straightway glorify him.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-013-033" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.013.033"><span class="verse-number">33</span>Little children, yet a little while I am with you. Ye shall seek me: and as I said unto the Jews, Whither I go, ye cannot come; so now I say to you.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-013-034" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.013.034"><span class="verse-number">34</span>A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-013-035" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.013.035"><span class="verse-number">35</span>By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-013-036" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.013.036"><span class="verse-number">36</span>Simon Peter said unto him, Lord, whither goest thou? Jesus answered him, Whither I go, thou canst not follow me now; but thou shalt follow me afterwards.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-013-037" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.013.037"><span class="verse-number">37</span>Peter said unto him, Lord, why cannot I follow thee now? I will lay down my life for thy sake.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-013-038" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.013.038"><span class="verse-number">38</span>Jesus answered him, Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake? Verily, verily, I say unto thee, The cock shall not crow, till thou hast denied me thrice.</p>
