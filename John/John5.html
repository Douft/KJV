            <p class="verse" id="v-43-005-001" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.005.001"><span class="verse-number">1</span>After this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-005-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.005.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-005-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.005.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-005-004" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.005.004"><span class="verse-number">4</span>For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-005-005" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.005.005"><span class="verse-number">5</span>And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and eight years.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-005-006" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.005.006"><span class="verse-number">6</span>When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time in that case, he saith unto him, Wilt thou be made whole?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-005-007" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.005.007"><span class="verse-number">7</span>The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth down before me.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-005-008" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.005.008"><span class="verse-number">8</span>Jesus saith unto him, Rise, take up thy bed, and walk.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-005-009" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.005.009"><span class="verse-number">9</span>And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and walked: and on the same day was the sabbath.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-005-010" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.005.010"><span class="verse-number">10</span>The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, It is the sabbath day: it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-005-011" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.005.011"><span class="verse-number">11</span>He answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me, Take up thy bed, and walk.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-005-012" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.005.012"><span class="verse-number">12</span>Then asked they him, What man is that which said unto thee, Take up thy bed, and walk?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-005-013" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.005.013"><span class="verse-number">13</span>And he that was healed wist not who it was: for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in that place.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-005-014" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.005.014"><span class="verse-number">14</span>Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him, Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-005-015" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.005.015"><span class="verse-number">15</span>The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus, which had made him whole.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-005-016" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.005.016"><span class="verse-number">16</span>And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to slay him, because he had done these things on the sabbath day.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-005-017" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.005.017"><span class="verse-number">17</span>But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-005-018" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.005.018"><span class="verse-number">18</span>Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father, making himself equal with God.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-005-019" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.005.019"><span class="verse-number">19</span>Then answered Jesus and said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do: for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-005-020" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.005.020"><span class="verse-number">20</span>For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things that himself doeth: and he will shew him greater works than these, that ye may marvel.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-005-021" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.005.021"><span class="verse-number">21</span>For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth them; even so the Son quickeneth whom he will.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-005-022" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.005.022"><span class="verse-number">22</span>For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-005-023" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.005.023"><span class="verse-number">23</span>That all men should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father. He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father which hath sent him.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-005-024" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.005.024"><span class="verse-number">24</span>Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-005-025" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.005.025"><span class="verse-number">25</span>Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-005-026" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.005.026"><span class="verse-number">26</span>For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself;</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-005-027" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.005.027"><span class="verse-number">27</span>And hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-005-028" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.005.028"><span class="verse-number">28</span>Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice,</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-005-029" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.005.029"><span class="verse-number">29</span>And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-005-030" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.005.030"><span class="verse-number">30</span>I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-005-031" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.005.031"><span class="verse-number">31</span>If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-005-032" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.005.032"><span class="verse-number">32</span>There is another that beareth witness of me; and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-005-033" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.005.033"><span class="verse-number">33</span>Ye sent unto John, and he bare witness unto the truth.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-005-034" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.005.034"><span class="verse-number">34</span>But I receive not testimony from man: but these things I say, that ye might be saved.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-005-035" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.005.035"><span class="verse-number">35</span>He was a burning and a shining light: and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-005-036" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.005.036"><span class="verse-number">36</span>But I have greater witness than that of John: for the works which the Father hath given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent me.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-005-037" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.005.037"><span class="verse-number">37</span>And the Father himself, which hath sent me, hath borne witness of me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-005-038" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.005.038"><span class="verse-number">38</span>And ye have not his word abiding in you: for whom he hath sent, him ye believe not.</p>
