            <p class="verse" id="v-43-008-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.008.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery; and when they had set her in the midst,</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-008-004" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.008.004"><span class="verse-number">4</span>They say unto him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-008-005" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.008.005"><span class="verse-number">5</span>Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned: but what sayest thou?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-008-006" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.008.006"><span class="verse-number">6</span>This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground, as though he heard them not.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-008-007" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.008.007"><span class="verse-number">7</span>So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-008-008" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.008.008"><span class="verse-number">8</span>And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-008-009" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.008.009"><span class="verse-number">9</span>And they which heard it, being convicted by their own conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, even unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-008-010" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.008.010"><span class="verse-number">10</span>When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-008-011" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.008.011"><span class="verse-number">11</span>She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-43-008-017" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.008.017"><span class="verse-number">17</span>It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men is true.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-43-008-019" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.008.019"><span class="verse-number">19</span>Then said they unto him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye neither know me, nor my Father: if ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-008-020" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.008.020"><span class="verse-number">20</span>These words spake Jesus in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man laid hands on him; for his hour was not yet come.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-008-021" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.008.021"><span class="verse-number">21</span>Then said Jesus again unto them, I go my way, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sins: whither I go, ye cannot come.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-008-022" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.008.022"><span class="verse-number">22</span>Then said the Jews, Will he kill himself? because he saith, Whither I go, ye cannot come.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-008-023" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.008.023"><span class="verse-number">23</span>And he said unto them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-008-024" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.008.024"><span class="verse-number">24</span>I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-008-025" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.008.025"><span class="verse-number">25</span>Then said they unto him, Who art thou? And Jesus saith unto them, Even the same that I said unto you from the beginning.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-008-026" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.008.026"><span class="verse-number">26</span>I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that sent me is true; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-008-027" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.008.027"><span class="verse-number">27</span>They understood not that he spake to them of the Father.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-008-028" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.008.028"><span class="verse-number">28</span>Then said Jesus unto them, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-008-029" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.008.029"><span class="verse-number">29</span>And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone; for I do always those things that please him.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-008-030" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.008.030"><span class="verse-number">30</span>As he spake these words, many believed on him.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-008-031" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.008.031"><span class="verse-number">31</span>Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed;</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-008-032" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.008.032"><span class="verse-number">32</span>And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-008-033" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.008.033"><span class="verse-number">33</span>They answered him, We be Abraham's seed, and were never in bondage to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-008-034" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.008.034"><span class="verse-number">34</span>Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-008-035" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.008.035"><span class="verse-number">35</span>And the servant abideth not in the house for ever: but the Son abideth ever.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-008-036" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.008.036"><span class="verse-number">36</span>If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-008-037" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.008.037"><span class="verse-number">37</span>I know that ye are Abraham's seed; but ye seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in you.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-008-038" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.008.038"><span class="verse-number">38</span>I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that which ye have seen with your father.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-008-039" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.008.039"><span class="verse-number">39</span>They answered and said unto him, Abraham is our father. Jesus saith unto them, If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works of Abraham.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-008-040" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.008.040"><span class="verse-number">40</span>But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard of God: this did not Abraham.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-008-041" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.008.041"><span class="verse-number">41</span>Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be not born of fornication; we have one Father, even God.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-008-042" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.008.042"><span class="verse-number">42</span>Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-008-043" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.008.043"><span class="verse-number">43</span>Why do ye not understand my speech? even because ye cannot hear my word.</p>

He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-008-045" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.008.045"><span class="verse-number">45</span>And because I tell you the truth, ye believe me not.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-43-008-050" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.008.050"><span class="verse-number">50</span>And I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-43-008-055" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.008.055"><span class="verse-number">55</span>Yet ye have not known him; but I know him: and if I should say, I know him not, I shall be a liar like unto you: but I know him, and keep his saying.</p>
