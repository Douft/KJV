            <p class="verse" id="v-43-003-005" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.003.005"><span class="verse-number">5</span>Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-003-006" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.003.006"><span class="verse-number">6</span>That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-43-003-017" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.003.017"><span class="verse-number">17</span>For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-43-003-032" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.003.032"><span class="verse-number">32</span>And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth; and no man receiveth his testimony.</p>
