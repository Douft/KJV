            <p class="verse" id="v-43-012-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.012.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>There they made him a supper; and Martha served: but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-012-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.012.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-012-004" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.012.004"><span class="verse-number">4</span>Then saith one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, which should betray him,</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-012-005" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.012.005"><span class="verse-number">5</span>Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-012-006" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.012.006"><span class="verse-number">6</span>This he said, not that he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and had the bag, and bare what was put therein.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-012-007" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.012.007"><span class="verse-number">7</span>Then said Jesus, Let her alone: against the day of my burying hath she kept this.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-012-008" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.012.008"><span class="verse-number">8</span>For the poor always ye have with you; but me ye have not always.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-012-009" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.012.009"><span class="verse-number">9</span>Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there: and they came not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-012-010" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.012.010"><span class="verse-number">10</span>But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death;</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-012-011" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.012.011"><span class="verse-number">11</span>Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-43-012-024" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.012.024"><span class="verse-number">24</span>Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-012-025" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.012.025"><span class="verse-number">25</span>He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-012-026" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.012.026"><span class="verse-number">26</span>If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will my Father honour.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-012-027" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.012.027"><span class="verse-number">27</span>Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-012-028" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.012.028"><span class="verse-number">28</span>Father, glorify thy name. Then came there a voice from heaven, saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-012-029" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.012.029"><span class="verse-number">29</span>The people therefore, that stood by, and heard it, said that it thundered: others said, An angel spake to him.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-012-030" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.012.030"><span class="verse-number">30</span>Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-012-031" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.012.031"><span class="verse-number">31</span>Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-012-032" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.012.032"><span class="verse-number">32</span>And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-012-033" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.012.033"><span class="verse-number">33</span>This he said, signifying what death he should die.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-012-034" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.012.034"><span class="verse-number">34</span>The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that Christ abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, The Son of man must be lifted up? who is this Son of man?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-012-035" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.012.035"><span class="verse-number">35</span>Then Jesus said unto them, Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you: for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-012-036" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.012.036"><span class="verse-number">36</span>While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light. These things spake Jesus, and departed, and did hide himself from them.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-012-037" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.012.037"><span class="verse-number">37</span>But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-012-038" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.012.038"><span class="verse-number">38</span>That the saying of Esaias the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spake, Lord, who hath believed our report? and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-012-039" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.012.039"><span class="verse-number">39</span>Therefore they could not believe, because that Esaias said again,</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-012-040" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.012.040"><span class="verse-number">40</span>He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that they should not see with their eyes, nor understand with their heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-012-041" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.012.041"><span class="verse-number">41</span>These things said Esaias, when he saw his glory, and spake of him.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-012-042" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.012.042"><span class="verse-number">42</span>Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-012-043" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.012.043"><span class="verse-number">43</span>For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-012-044" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.012.044"><span class="verse-number">44</span>Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-012-045" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.012.045"><span class="verse-number">45</span>And he that seeth me seeth him that sent me.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-012-046" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.012.046"><span class="verse-number">46</span>I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-012-047" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.012.047"><span class="verse-number">47</span>And if any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-012-048" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.012.048"><span class="verse-number">48</span>He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-012-049" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.012.049"><span class="verse-number">49</span>For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-012-050" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.012.050"><span class="verse-number">50</span>And I know that his commandment is life everlasting: whatsoever I speak therefore, even as the Father said unto me, so I speak.</p>
