            <p class="verse" id="v-43-016-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.016.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>They shall put you out of the synagogues: yea, the time cometh, that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-016-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.016.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>And these things will they do unto you, because they have not known the Father, nor me.</p>

And these things I said not unto you at the beginning, because I was with you.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-016-005" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.016.005"><span class="verse-number">5</span>But now I go my way to him that sent me; and none of you asketh me, Whither goest thou?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-016-006" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.016.006"><span class="verse-number">6</span>But because I have said these things unto you, sorrow hath filled your heart.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-43-016-020" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.016.020"><span class="verse-number">20</span>Verily, verily, I say unto you, That ye shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice: and ye shall be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-016-021" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.016.021"><span class="verse-number">21</span>A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow, because her hour is come: but as soon as she is delivered of the child, she remembereth no more the anguish, for joy that a man is born into the world.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-016-022" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.016.022"><span class="verse-number">22</span>And ye now therefore have sorrow: but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no man taketh from you.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-016-023" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.016.023"><span class="verse-number">23</span>And in that day ye shall ask me nothing. Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-016-024" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.016.024"><span class="verse-number">24</span>Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-016-025" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.016.025"><span class="verse-number">25</span>These things have I spoken unto you in proverbs: but the time cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs, but I shall shew you plainly of the Father.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-016-026" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.016.026"><span class="verse-number">26</span>At that day ye shall ask in my name: and I say not unto you, that I will pray the Father for you:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-016-027" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.016.027"><span class="verse-number">27</span>For the Father himself loveth you, because ye have loved me, and have believed that I came out from God.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-016-028" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.016.028"><span class="verse-number">28</span>I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world: again, I leave the world, and go to the Father.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-016-029" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.016.029"><span class="verse-number">29</span>His disciples said unto him, Lo, now speakest thou plainly, and speakest no proverb.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-016-030" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.016.030"><span class="verse-number">30</span>Now are we sure that thou knowest all things, and needest not that any man should ask thee: by this we believe that thou camest forth from God.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-016-031" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.016.031"><span class="verse-number">31</span>Jesus answered them, Do ye now believe?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-016-032" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.016.032"><span class="verse-number">32</span>Behold, the hour cometh, yea, is now come, that ye shall be scattered, every man to his own, and shall leave me alone: and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-43-016-033" data-verse-ref="KJV.43.016.033"><span class="verse-number">33</span>These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.</p>
