            <p class="verse" id="v-59-001-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.59.001.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations;</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-59-001-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.59.001.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>Knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh patience.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-59-001-004" data-verse-ref="KJV.59.001.004"><span class="verse-number">4</span>But let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-59-001-005" data-verse-ref="KJV.59.001.005"><span class="verse-number">5</span>If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-59-001-006" data-verse-ref="KJV.59.001.006"><span class="verse-number">6</span>But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-59-001-007" data-verse-ref="KJV.59.001.007"><span class="verse-number">7</span>For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-59-001-009" data-verse-ref="KJV.59.001.009"><span class="verse-number">9</span>Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-59-001-010" data-verse-ref="KJV.59.001.010"><span class="verse-number">10</span>But the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-59-001-011" data-verse-ref="KJV.59.001.011"><span class="verse-number">11</span>For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it withereth the grass, and the flower thereof falleth, and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-59-001-012" data-verse-ref="KJV.59.001.012"><span class="verse-number">12</span>Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-59-001-014" data-verse-ref="KJV.59.001.014"><span class="verse-number">14</span>But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-59-001-015" data-verse-ref="KJV.59.001.015"><span class="verse-number">15</span>Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-59-001-017" data-verse-ref="KJV.59.001.017"><span class="verse-number">17</span>Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-59-001-018" data-verse-ref="KJV.59.001.018"><span class="verse-number">18</span>Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-59-001-020" data-verse-ref="KJV.59.001.020"><span class="verse-number">20</span>For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-59-001-021" data-verse-ref="KJV.59.001.021"><span class="verse-number">21</span>Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-59-001-022" data-verse-ref="KJV.59.001.022"><span class="verse-number">22</span>But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-59-001-023" data-verse-ref="KJV.59.001.023"><span class="verse-number">23</span>For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-59-001-024" data-verse-ref="KJV.59.001.024"><span class="verse-number">24</span>For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-59-001-025" data-verse-ref="KJV.59.001.025"><span class="verse-number">25</span>But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-59-001-026" data-verse-ref="KJV.59.001.026"><span class="verse-number">26</span>If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man's religion is vain.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-59-001-027" data-verse-ref="KJV.59.001.027"><span class="verse-number">27</span>Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.</p>
