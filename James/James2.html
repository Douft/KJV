            <p class="verse" id="v-59-002-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.59.002.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>For if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring, in goodly apparel, and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment;</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-59-002-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.59.002.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>And ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing, and say unto him, Sit thou here in a good place; and say to the poor, Stand thou there, or sit here under my footstool:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-59-002-004" data-verse-ref="KJV.59.002.004"><span class="verse-number">4</span>Are ye not then partial in yourselves, and are become judges of evil thoughts?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-59-002-005" data-verse-ref="KJV.59.002.005"><span class="verse-number">5</span>Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-59-002-006" data-verse-ref="KJV.59.002.006"><span class="verse-number">6</span>But ye have despised the poor. Do not rich men oppress you, and draw you before the judgment seats?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-59-002-007" data-verse-ref="KJV.59.002.007"><span class="verse-number">7</span>Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are called?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-59-002-008" data-verse-ref="KJV.59.002.008"><span class="verse-number">8</span>If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-59-002-009" data-verse-ref="KJV.59.002.009"><span class="verse-number">9</span>But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-59-002-010" data-verse-ref="KJV.59.002.010"><span class="verse-number">10</span>For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-59-002-011" data-verse-ref="KJV.59.002.011"><span class="verse-number">11</span>For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-59-002-013" data-verse-ref="KJV.59.002.013"><span class="verse-number">13</span>For he shall have judgment without mercy, that hath shewed no mercy; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-59-002-018" data-verse-ref="KJV.59.002.018"><span class="verse-number">18</span>Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-59-002-019" data-verse-ref="KJV.59.002.019"><span class="verse-number">19</span>Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-59-002-020" data-verse-ref="KJV.59.002.020"><span class="verse-number">20</span>But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-59-002-022" data-verse-ref="KJV.59.002.022"><span class="verse-number">22</span>Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-59-002-023" data-verse-ref="KJV.59.002.023"><span class="verse-number">23</span>And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-59-002-024" data-verse-ref="KJV.59.002.024"><span class="verse-number">24</span>Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-59-002-025" data-verse-ref="KJV.59.002.025"><span class="verse-number">25</span>Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she had received the messengers, and had sent them out another way?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-59-002-026" data-verse-ref="KJV.59.002.026"><span class="verse-number">26</span>For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.</p>
