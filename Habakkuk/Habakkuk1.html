            <p class="verse" id="v-35-001-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.35.001.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>O LORD, how long shall I cry, and thou wilt not hear! even cry out unto thee of violence, and thou wilt not save!</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-35-001-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.35.001.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>Why dost thou shew me iniquity, and cause me to behold grievance? for spoiling and violence are before me: and there are that raise up strife and contention.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-35-001-004" data-verse-ref="KJV.35.001.004"><span class="verse-number">4</span>Therefore the law is slacked, and judgment doth never go forth: for the wicked doth compass about the righteous; therefore wrong judgment proceedeth.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-35-001-005" data-verse-ref="KJV.35.001.005"><span class="verse-number">5</span>Behold ye among the heathen, and regard, and wonder marvellously: for I will work a work in your days, which ye will not believe, though it be told you.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-35-001-006" data-verse-ref="KJV.35.001.006"><span class="verse-number">6</span>For, lo, I raise up the Chaldeans, that bitter and hasty nation, which shall march through the breadth of the land, to possess the dwellingplaces that are not theirs.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-35-001-007" data-verse-ref="KJV.35.001.007"><span class="verse-number">7</span>They are terrible and dreadful: their judgment and their dignity shall proceed of themselves.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-35-001-009" data-verse-ref="KJV.35.001.009"><span class="verse-number">9</span>They shall come all for violence: their faces shall sup up as the east wind, and they shall gather the captivity as the sand.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-35-001-010" data-verse-ref="KJV.35.001.010"><span class="verse-number">10</span>And they shall scoff at the kings, and the princes shall be a scorn unto them: they shall deride every strong hold; for they shall heap dust, and take it.</p>

O LORD, thou hast ordained them for judgment; and, O mighty God, thou hast established them for correction.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-35-001-014" data-verse-ref="KJV.35.001.014"><span class="verse-number">14</span>And makest men as the fishes of the sea, as the creeping things, that have no ruler over them?</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-35-001-016" data-verse-ref="KJV.35.001.016"><span class="verse-number">16</span>Therefore they sacrifice unto their net, and burn incense unto their drag; because by them their portion is fat, and their meat plenteous.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-35-001-017" data-verse-ref="KJV.35.001.017"><span class="verse-number">17</span>Shall they therefore empty their net, and not spare continually to slay the nations?</p>
