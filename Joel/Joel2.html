            <p class="verse" id="v-29-002-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.29.002.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>A day of darkness and of gloominess, a day of clouds and of thick darkness, as the morning spread upon the mountains: a great people and a strong; there hath not been ever the like, neither shall be any more after it, even to the years of many generations.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-29-002-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.29.002.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>A fire devoureth before them; and behind them a flame burneth: the land is as the garden of Eden before them, and behind them a desolate wilderness; yea, and nothing shall escape them.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-29-002-004" data-verse-ref="KJV.29.002.004"><span class="verse-number">4</span>The appearance of them is as the appearance of horses; and as horsemen, so shall they run.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-29-002-005" data-verse-ref="KJV.29.002.005"><span class="verse-number">5</span>Like the noise of chariots on the tops of mountains shall they leap, like the noise of a flame of fire that devoureth the stubble, as a strong people set in battle array.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-29-002-021" data-verse-ref="KJV.29.002.021"><span class="verse-number">21</span>Fear not, O land; be glad and rejoice: for the LORD will do great things.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-29-002-023" data-verse-ref="KJV.29.002.023"><span class="verse-number">23</span>Be glad then, ye children of Zion, and rejoice in the LORD your God: for he hath given you the former rain moderately, and he will cause to come down for you the rain, the former rain, and the latter rain in the first month.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-29-002-024" data-verse-ref="KJV.29.002.024"><span class="verse-number">24</span>And the floors shall be full of wheat, and the fats shall overflow with wine and oil.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-29-002-026" data-verse-ref="KJV.29.002.026"><span class="verse-number">26</span>And ye shall eat in plenty, and be satisfied, and praise the name of the LORD your God, that hath dealt wondrously with you: and my people shall never be ashamed.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-29-002-027" data-verse-ref="KJV.29.002.027"><span class="verse-number">27</span>And ye shall know that I am in the midst of Israel, and that I am the LORD your God, and none else: and my people shall never be ashamed.</p>
