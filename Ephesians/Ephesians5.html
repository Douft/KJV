            <p class="verse" id="v-49-005-012" data-verse-ref="KJV.49.005.012"><span class="verse-number">12</span>For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-49-005-023" data-verse-ref="KJV.49.005.023"><span class="verse-number">23</span>For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-49-005-024" data-verse-ref="KJV.49.005.024"><span class="verse-number">24</span>Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-49-005-026" data-verse-ref="KJV.49.005.026"><span class="verse-number">26</span>That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word,</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-49-005-027" data-verse-ref="KJV.49.005.027"><span class="verse-number">27</span>That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-49-005-028" data-verse-ref="KJV.49.005.028"><span class="verse-number">28</span>So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-49-005-029" data-verse-ref="KJV.49.005.029"><span class="verse-number">29</span>For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-49-005-030" data-verse-ref="KJV.49.005.030"><span class="verse-number">30</span>For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-49-005-031" data-verse-ref="KJV.49.005.031"><span class="verse-number">31</span>For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh.</p>
