            <p class="verse" id="v-38-007-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.38.007.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>When they had sent unto the house of God Sherezer and Regemmelech, and their men, to pray before the LORD,</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-38-007-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.38.007.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>And to speak unto the priests which were in the house of the LORD of hosts, and to the prophets, saying, Should I weep in the fifth month, separating myself, as I have done these so many years?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-38-007-004" data-verse-ref="KJV.38.007.004"><span class="verse-number">4</span>Then came the word of the LORD of hosts unto me, saying,</p>
