            <p class="verse" id="v-38-001-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.38.001.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>The LORD hath been sore displeased with your fathers.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-38-001-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.38.001.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>Therefore say thou unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Turn ye unto me, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will turn unto you, saith the LORD of hosts.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-38-001-004" data-verse-ref="KJV.38.001.004"><span class="verse-number">4</span>Be ye not as your fathers, unto whom the former prophets have cried, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Turn ye now from your evil ways, and from your evil doings: but they did not hear, nor hearken unto me, saith the LORD.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-38-001-005" data-verse-ref="KJV.38.001.005"><span class="verse-number">5</span>Your fathers, where are they? and the prophets, do they live for ever?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-38-001-006" data-verse-ref="KJV.38.001.006"><span class="verse-number">6</span>But my words and my statutes, which I commanded my servants the prophets, did they not take hold of your fathers? and they returned and said, Like as the LORD of hosts thought to do unto us, according to our ways, and according to our doings, so hath he dealt with us.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-38-001-007" data-verse-ref="KJV.38.001.007"><span class="verse-number">7</span>Upon the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month, which is the month Sebat, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the LORD unto Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo the prophet, saying,</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-38-001-008" data-verse-ref="KJV.38.001.008"><span class="verse-number">8</span>I saw by night, and behold a man riding upon a red horse, and he stood among the myrtle trees that were in the bottom; and behind him were there red horses, speckled, and white.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-38-001-009" data-verse-ref="KJV.38.001.009"><span class="verse-number">9</span>Then said I, O my lord, what are these? And the angel that talked with me said unto me, I will shew thee what these be.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-38-001-016" data-verse-ref="KJV.38.001.016"><span class="verse-number">16</span>Therefore thus saith the LORD; I am returned to Jerusalem with mercies: my house shall be built in it, saith the LORD of hosts, and a line shall be stretched forth upon Jerusalem.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-38-001-017" data-verse-ref="KJV.38.001.017"><span class="verse-number">17</span>Cry yet, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; My cities through prosperity shall yet be spread abroad; and the LORD shall yet comfort Zion, and shall yet choose Jerusalem.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-38-001-018" data-verse-ref="KJV.38.001.018"><span class="verse-number">18</span>Then lifted I up mine eyes, and saw, and behold four horns.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-38-001-019" data-verse-ref="KJV.38.001.019"><span class="verse-number">19</span>And I said unto the angel that talked with me, What be these? And he answered me, These are the horns which have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-38-001-020" data-verse-ref="KJV.38.001.020"><span class="verse-number">20</span>And the LORD shewed me four carpenters.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-38-001-021" data-verse-ref="KJV.38.001.021"><span class="verse-number">21</span>Then said I, What come these to do? And he spake, saying, These are the horns which have scattered Judah, so that no man did lift up his head: but these are come to fray them, to cast out the horns of the Gentiles, which lifted up their horn over the land of Judah to scatter it.</p>
