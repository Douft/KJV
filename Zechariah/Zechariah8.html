            <p class="verse" id="v-38-008-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.38.008.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>Thus saith the LORD; I am returned unto Zion, and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem: and Jerusalem shall be called a city of truth; and the mountain of the LORD of hosts the holy mountain.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-38-008-004" data-verse-ref="KJV.38.008.004"><span class="verse-number">4</span>Thus saith the LORD of hosts; There shall yet old men and old women dwell in the streets of Jerusalem, and every man with his staff in his hand for very age.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-38-008-005" data-verse-ref="KJV.38.008.005"><span class="verse-number">5</span>And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in the streets thereof.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-38-008-009" data-verse-ref="KJV.38.008.009"><span class="verse-number">9</span>Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Let your hands be strong, ye that hear in these days these words by the mouth of the prophets, which were in the day that the foundation of the house of the LORD of hosts was laid, that the temple might be built.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-38-008-010" data-verse-ref="KJV.38.008.010"><span class="verse-number">10</span>For before these days there was no hire for man, nor any hire for beast; neither was there any peace to him that went out or came in because of the affliction: for I set all men every one against his neighbour.</p>
