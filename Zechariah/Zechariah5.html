            <p class="verse" id="v-38-005-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.38.005.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>And he said unto me, What seest thou? And I answered, I see a flying roll; the length thereof is twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof ten cubits.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-38-005-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.38.005.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>Then said he unto me, This is the curse that goeth forth over the face of the whole earth: for every one that stealeth shall be cut off as on this side according to it; and every one that sweareth shall be cut off as on that side according to it.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-38-005-004" data-verse-ref="KJV.38.005.004"><span class="verse-number">4</span>I will bring it forth, saith the LORD of hosts, and it shall enter into the house of the thief, and into the house of him that sweareth falsely by my name: and it shall remain in the midst of his house, and shall consume it with the timber thereof and the stones thereof.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-38-005-005" data-verse-ref="KJV.38.005.005"><span class="verse-number">5</span>Then the angel that talked with me went forth, and said unto me, Lift up now thine eyes, and see what is this that goeth forth.</p>
