            <p class="verse" id="v-50-002-001" data-verse-ref="KJV.50.002.001"><span class="verse-number">1</span>If there be therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies,</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-50-002-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.50.002.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>Fulfil ye my joy, that ye be likeminded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-50-002-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.50.002.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-50-002-004" data-verse-ref="KJV.50.002.004"><span class="verse-number">4</span>Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-50-002-005" data-verse-ref="KJV.50.002.005"><span class="verse-number">5</span>Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-50-002-006" data-verse-ref="KJV.50.002.006"><span class="verse-number">6</span>Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-50-002-007" data-verse-ref="KJV.50.002.007"><span class="verse-number">7</span>But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-50-002-008" data-verse-ref="KJV.50.002.008"><span class="verse-number">8</span>And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-50-002-009" data-verse-ref="KJV.50.002.009"><span class="verse-number">9</span>Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-50-002-010" data-verse-ref="KJV.50.002.010"><span class="verse-number">10</span>That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth;</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-50-002-011" data-verse-ref="KJV.50.002.011"><span class="verse-number">11</span>And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-50-002-012" data-verse-ref="KJV.50.002.012"><span class="verse-number">12</span>Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-50-002-013" data-verse-ref="KJV.50.002.013"><span class="verse-number">13</span>For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-50-002-014" data-verse-ref="KJV.50.002.014"><span class="verse-number">14</span>Do all things without murmurings and disputings:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-50-002-015" data-verse-ref="KJV.50.002.015"><span class="verse-number">15</span>That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world;</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-50-002-016" data-verse-ref="KJV.50.002.016"><span class="verse-number">16</span>Holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither laboured in vain.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-50-002-017" data-verse-ref="KJV.50.002.017"><span class="verse-number">17</span>Yea, and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-50-002-018" data-verse-ref="KJV.50.002.018"><span class="verse-number">18</span>For the same cause also do ye joy, and rejoice with me.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-50-002-019" data-verse-ref="KJV.50.002.019"><span class="verse-number">19</span>But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timotheus shortly unto you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your state.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-50-002-020" data-verse-ref="KJV.50.002.020"><span class="verse-number">20</span>For I have no man likeminded, who will naturally care for your state.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-50-002-021" data-verse-ref="KJV.50.002.021"><span class="verse-number">21</span>For all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ's.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-50-002-022" data-verse-ref="KJV.50.002.022"><span class="verse-number">22</span>But ye know the proof of him, that, as a son with the father, he hath served with me in the gospel.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-50-002-023" data-verse-ref="KJV.50.002.023"><span class="verse-number">23</span>Him therefore I hope to send presently, so soon as I shall see how it will go with me.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-50-002-024" data-verse-ref="KJV.50.002.024"><span class="verse-number">24</span>But I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-50-002-025" data-verse-ref="KJV.50.002.025"><span class="verse-number">25</span>Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, and companion in labour, and fellowsoldier, but your messenger, and he that ministered to my wants.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-50-002-026" data-verse-ref="KJV.50.002.026"><span class="verse-number">26</span>For he longed after you all, and was full of heaviness, because that ye had heard that he had been sick.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-50-002-027" data-verse-ref="KJV.50.002.027"><span class="verse-number">27</span>For indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-50-002-028" data-verse-ref="KJV.50.002.028"><span class="verse-number">28</span>I sent him therefore the more carefully, that, when ye see him again, ye may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-50-002-029" data-verse-ref="KJV.50.002.029"><span class="verse-number">29</span>Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness; and hold such in reputation:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-50-002-030" data-verse-ref="KJV.50.002.030"><span class="verse-number">30</span>Because for the work of Christ he was nigh unto death, not regarding his life, to supply your lack of service toward me.</p>
