            <p class="verse" id="v-52-004-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.52.004.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>For ye know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-52-004-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.52.004.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that ye should abstain from fornication:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-52-004-004" data-verse-ref="KJV.52.004.004"><span class="verse-number">4</span>That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour;</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-52-004-005" data-verse-ref="KJV.52.004.005"><span class="verse-number">5</span>Not in the lust of concupiscence, even as the Gentiles which know not God:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-52-004-006" data-verse-ref="KJV.52.004.006"><span class="verse-number">6</span>That no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any matter: because that the Lord is the avenger of all such, as we also have forewarned you and testified.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-52-004-007" data-verse-ref="KJV.52.004.007"><span class="verse-number">7</span>For God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-52-004-009" data-verse-ref="KJV.52.004.009"><span class="verse-number">9</span>But as touching brotherly love ye need not that I write unto you: for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-52-004-010" data-verse-ref="KJV.52.004.010"><span class="verse-number">10</span>And indeed ye do it toward all the brethren which are in all Macedonia: but we beseech you, brethren, that ye increase more and more;</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-52-004-011" data-verse-ref="KJV.52.004.011"><span class="verse-number">11</span>And that ye study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you;</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-52-004-012" data-verse-ref="KJV.52.004.012"><span class="verse-number">12</span>That ye may walk honestly toward them that are without, and that ye may have lack of nothing.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-52-004-013" data-verse-ref="KJV.52.004.013"><span class="verse-number">13</span>But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-52-004-014" data-verse-ref="KJV.52.004.014"><span class="verse-number">14</span>For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-52-004-017" data-verse-ref="KJV.52.004.017"><span class="verse-number">17</span>Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-52-004-018" data-verse-ref="KJV.52.004.018"><span class="verse-number">18</span>Wherefore comfort one another with these words.</p>
