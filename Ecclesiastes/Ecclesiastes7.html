            <p class="verse" id="v-21-007-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.21.007.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>It is better to go to the house of mourning, than to go to the house of feasting: for that is the end of all men; and the living will lay it to his heart.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-21-007-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.21.007.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>Sorrow is better than laughter: for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-21-007-004" data-verse-ref="KJV.21.007.004"><span class="verse-number">4</span>The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-21-007-005" data-verse-ref="KJV.21.007.005"><span class="verse-number">5</span>It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man to hear the song of fools.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-21-007-006" data-verse-ref="KJV.21.007.006"><span class="verse-number">6</span>For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter of the fool: this also is vanity.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-21-007-007" data-verse-ref="KJV.21.007.007"><span class="verse-number">7</span>Surely oppression maketh a wise man mad; and a gift destroyeth the heart.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-21-007-008" data-verse-ref="KJV.21.007.008"><span class="verse-number">8</span>Better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof: and the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-21-007-009" data-verse-ref="KJV.21.007.009"><span class="verse-number">9</span>Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry: for anger resteth in the bosom of fools.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-21-007-012" data-verse-ref="KJV.21.007.012"><span class="verse-number">12</span>For wisdom is a defence, and money is a defence: but the excellency of knowledge is, that wisdom giveth life to them that have it.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-21-007-018" data-verse-ref="KJV.21.007.018"><span class="verse-number">18</span>It is good that thou shouldest take hold of this; yea, also from this withdraw not thine hand: for he that feareth God shall come forth of them all.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-21-007-019" data-verse-ref="KJV.21.007.019"><span class="verse-number">19</span>Wisdom strengtheneth the wise more than ten mighty men which are in the city.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-21-007-020" data-verse-ref="KJV.21.007.020"><span class="verse-number">20</span>For there is not a just man upon earth, that doeth good, and sinneth not.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-21-007-022" data-verse-ref="KJV.21.007.022"><span class="verse-number">22</span>For oftentimes also thine own heart knoweth that thou thyself likewise hast cursed others.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-21-007-026" data-verse-ref="KJV.21.007.026"><span class="verse-number">26</span>And I find more bitter than death the woman, whose heart is snares and nets, and her hands as bands: whoso pleaseth God shall escape from her; but the sinner shall be taken by her.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-21-007-027" data-verse-ref="KJV.21.007.027"><span class="verse-number">27</span>Behold, this have I found, saith the preacher, counting one by one, to find out the account:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-21-007-028" data-verse-ref="KJV.21.007.028"><span class="verse-number">28</span>Which yet my soul seeketh, but I find not: one man among a thousand have I found; but a woman among all those have I not found.</p>
