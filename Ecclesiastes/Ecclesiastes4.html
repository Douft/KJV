            <p class="verse" id="v-21-004-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.21.004.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>Wherefore I praised the dead which are already dead more than the living which are yet alive.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-21-004-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.21.004.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>Yea, better is he than both they, which hath not yet been, who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-21-004-004" data-verse-ref="KJV.21.004.004"><span class="verse-number">4</span>Again, I considered all travail, and every right work, that for this a man is envied of his neighbour. This is also vanity and vexation of spirit.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-21-004-005" data-verse-ref="KJV.21.004.005"><span class="verse-number">5</span>The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-21-004-006" data-verse-ref="KJV.21.004.006"><span class="verse-number">6</span>Better is an handful with quietness, than both the hands full with travail and vexation of spirit.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-21-004-007" data-verse-ref="KJV.21.004.007"><span class="verse-number">7</span>Then I returned, and I saw vanity under the sun.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-21-004-008" data-verse-ref="KJV.21.004.008"><span class="verse-number">8</span>There is one alone, and there is not a second; yea, he hath neither child nor brother: yet is there no end of all his labour; neither is his eye satisfied with riches; neither saith he, For whom do I labour, and bereave my soul of good? This is also vanity, yea, it is a sore travail.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-21-004-009" data-verse-ref="KJV.21.004.009"><span class="verse-number">9</span>Two are better than one; because they have a good reward for their labour.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-21-004-010" data-verse-ref="KJV.21.004.010"><span class="verse-number">10</span>For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to him that is alone when he falleth; for he hath not another to help him up.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-21-004-011" data-verse-ref="KJV.21.004.011"><span class="verse-number">11</span>Again, if two lie together, then they have heat: but how can one be warm alone?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-21-004-012" data-verse-ref="KJV.21.004.012"><span class="verse-number">12</span>And if one prevail against him, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-21-004-013" data-verse-ref="KJV.21.004.013"><span class="verse-number">13</span>Better is a poor and a wise child than an old and foolish king, who will no more be admonished.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-21-004-014" data-verse-ref="KJV.21.004.014"><span class="verse-number">14</span>For out of prison he cometh to reign; whereas also he that is born in his kingdom becometh poor.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-21-004-015" data-verse-ref="KJV.21.004.015"><span class="verse-number">15</span>I considered all the living which walk under the sun, with the second child that shall stand up in his stead.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-21-004-016" data-verse-ref="KJV.21.004.016"><span class="verse-number">16</span>There is no end of all the people, even of all that have been before them: they also that come after shall not rejoice in him. Surely this also is vanity and vexation of spirit.</p>
