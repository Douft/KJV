            <p class="verse" id="v-21-008-001" data-verse-ref="KJV.21.008.001"><span class="verse-number">1</span>Who is as the wise man? and who knoweth the interpretation of a thing? a man's wisdom maketh his face to shine, and the boldness of his face shall be changed.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-21-008-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.21.008.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>I counsel thee to keep the king's commandment, and that in regard of the oath of God.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-21-008-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.21.008.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>Be not hasty to go out of his sight: stand not in an evil thing; for he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-21-008-004" data-verse-ref="KJV.21.008.004"><span class="verse-number">4</span>Where the word of a king is, there is power: and who may say unto him, What doest thou?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-21-008-005" data-verse-ref="KJV.21.008.005"><span class="verse-number">5</span>Whoso keepeth the commandment shall feel no evil thing: and a wise man's heart discerneth both time and judgment.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-21-008-006" data-verse-ref="KJV.21.008.006"><span class="verse-number">6</span>Because to every purpose there is time and judgment, therefore the misery of man is great upon him.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-21-008-007" data-verse-ref="KJV.21.008.007"><span class="verse-number">7</span>For he knoweth not that which shall be: for who can tell him when it shall be?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-21-008-008" data-verse-ref="KJV.21.008.008"><span class="verse-number">8</span>There is no man that hath power over the spirit to retain the spirit; neither hath he power in the day of death: and there is no discharge in that war; neither shall wickedness deliver those that are given to it.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-21-008-009" data-verse-ref="KJV.21.008.009"><span class="verse-number">9</span>All this have I seen, and applied my heart unto every work that is done under the sun: there is a time wherein one man ruleth over another to his own hurt.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-21-008-010" data-verse-ref="KJV.21.008.010"><span class="verse-number">10</span>And so I saw the wicked buried, who had come and gone from the place of the holy, and they were forgotten in the city where they had so done: this is also vanity.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-21-008-011" data-verse-ref="KJV.21.008.011"><span class="verse-number">11</span>Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-21-008-012" data-verse-ref="KJV.21.008.012"><span class="verse-number">12</span>Though a sinner do evil an hundred times, and his days be prolonged, yet surely I know that it shall be well with them that fear God, which fear before him:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-21-008-013" data-verse-ref="KJV.21.008.013"><span class="verse-number">13</span>But it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall he prolong his days, which are as a shadow; because he feareth not before God.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-21-008-014" data-verse-ref="KJV.21.008.014"><span class="verse-number">14</span>There is a vanity which is done upon the earth; that there be just men, unto whom it happeneth according to the work of the wicked; again, there be wicked men, to whom it happeneth according to the work of the righteous: I said that this also is vanity.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-21-008-015" data-verse-ref="KJV.21.008.015"><span class="verse-number">15</span>Then I commended mirth, because a man hath no better thing under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be merry: for that shall abide with him of his labour the days of his life, which God giveth him under the sun.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-21-008-016" data-verse-ref="KJV.21.008.016"><span class="verse-number">16</span>When I applied mine heart to know wisdom, and to see the business that is done upon the earth: (for also there is that neither day nor night seeth sleep with his eyes:)</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-21-008-017" data-verse-ref="KJV.21.008.017"><span class="verse-number">17</span>Then I beheld all the work of God, that a man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun: because though a man labour to seek it out, yet he shall not find it; yea further; though a wise man think to know it, yet shall he not be able to find it.</p>
