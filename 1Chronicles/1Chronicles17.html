            <p class="verse" id="v-13-017-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.13.017.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>Then Nathan said unto David, Do all that is in thine heart; for God is with thee.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-13-017-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.13.017.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>And it came to pass the same night, that the word of God came to Nathan, saying,</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-13-017-004" data-verse-ref="KJV.13.017.004"><span class="verse-number">4</span>Go and tell David my servant, Thus saith the LORD, Thou shalt not build me an house to dwell in:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-13-017-005" data-verse-ref="KJV.13.017.005"><span class="verse-number">5</span>For I have not dwelt in an house since the day that I brought up Israel unto this day; but have gone from tent to tent, and from one tabernacle to another.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-13-017-006" data-verse-ref="KJV.13.017.006"><span class="verse-number">6</span>Wheresoever I have walked with all Israel, spake I a word to any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people, saying, Why have ye not built me an house of cedars?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-13-017-007" data-verse-ref="KJV.13.017.007"><span class="verse-number">7</span>Now therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, even from following the sheep, that thou shouldest be ruler over my people Israel:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-13-017-008" data-verse-ref="KJV.13.017.008"><span class="verse-number">8</span>And I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast walked, and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee, and have made thee a name like the name of the great men that are in the earth.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-13-017-009" data-verse-ref="KJV.13.017.009"><span class="verse-number">9</span>Also I will ordain a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, and they shall dwell in their place, and shall be moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more, as at the beginning,</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-13-017-010" data-verse-ref="KJV.13.017.010"><span class="verse-number">10</span>And since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel. Moreover I will subdue all thine enemies. Furthermore I tell thee that the LORD will build thee an house.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-13-017-016" data-verse-ref="KJV.13.017.016"><span class="verse-number">16</span>And David the king came and sat before the LORD, and said, Who am I, O LORD God, and what is mine house, that thou hast brought me hitherto?</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-13-017-018" data-verse-ref="KJV.13.017.018"><span class="verse-number">18</span>What can David speak more to thee for the honour of thy servant? for thou knowest thy servant.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-13-017-021" data-verse-ref="KJV.13.017.021"><span class="verse-number">21</span>And what one nation in the earth is like thy people Israel, whom God went to redeem to be his own people, to make thee a name of greatness and terribleness, by driving out nations from before thy people, whom thou hast redeemed out of Egypt?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-13-017-022" data-verse-ref="KJV.13.017.022"><span class="verse-number">22</span>For thy people Israel didst thou make thine own people for ever; and thou, LORD, becamest their God.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-13-017-023" data-verse-ref="KJV.13.017.023"><span class="verse-number">23</span>Therefore now, LORD, let the thing that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant and concerning his house be established for ever, and do as thou hast said.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-13-017-024" data-verse-ref="KJV.13.017.024"><span class="verse-number">24</span>Let it even be established, that thy name may be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of hosts is the God of Israel, even a God to Israel: and let the house of David thy servant be established before thee.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-13-017-025" data-verse-ref="KJV.13.017.025"><span class="verse-number">25</span>For thou, O my God, hast told thy servant that thou wilt build him an house: therefore thy servant hath found in his heart to pray before thee.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-13-017-026" data-verse-ref="KJV.13.017.026"><span class="verse-number">26</span>And now, LORD, thou art God, and hast promised this goodness unto thy servant:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-13-017-027" data-verse-ref="KJV.13.017.027"><span class="verse-number">27</span>Now therefore let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may be before thee for ever: for thou blessest, O LORD, and it shall be blessed for ever.</p>
