            <p class="verse" id="v-33-004-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.33.004.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>And many nations shall come, and say, Come, and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, and to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for the law shall go forth of Zion, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-33-004-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.33.004.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>And he shall judge among many people, and rebuke strong nations afar off; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up a sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-33-004-004" data-verse-ref="KJV.33.004.004"><span class="verse-number">4</span>But they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree; and none shall make them afraid: for the mouth of the LORD of hosts hath spoken it.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-33-004-005" data-verse-ref="KJV.33.004.005"><span class="verse-number">5</span>For all people will walk every one in the name of his god, and we will walk in the name of the LORD our God for ever and ever.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-33-004-007" data-verse-ref="KJV.33.004.007"><span class="verse-number">7</span>And I will make her that halted a remnant, and her that was cast far off a strong nation: and the LORD shall reign over them in mount Zion from henceforth, even for ever.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-33-004-008" data-verse-ref="KJV.33.004.008"><span class="verse-number">8</span>And thou, O tower of the flock, the strong hold of the daughter of Zion, unto thee shall it come, even the first dominion; the kingdom shall come to the daughter of Jerusalem.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-33-004-009" data-verse-ref="KJV.33.004.009"><span class="verse-number">9</span>Now why dost thou cry out aloud? is there no king in thee? is thy counseller perished? for pangs have taken thee as a woman in travail.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-33-004-011" data-verse-ref="KJV.33.004.011"><span class="verse-number">11</span>Now also many nations are gathered against thee, that say, Let her be defiled, and let our eye look upon Zion.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-33-004-012" data-verse-ref="KJV.33.004.012"><span class="verse-number">12</span>But they know not the thoughts of the LORD, neither understand they his counsel: for he shall gather them as the sheaves into the floor.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-33-004-013" data-verse-ref="KJV.33.004.013"><span class="verse-number">13</span>Arise and thresh, O daughter of Zion: for I will make thine horn iron, and I will make thy hoofs brass: and thou shalt beat in pieces many people: and I will consecrate their gain unto the LORD, and their substance unto the Lord of the whole earth.</p>
