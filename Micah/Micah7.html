            <p class="verse" id="v-33-007-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.33.007.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>The good man is perished out of the earth: and there is none upright among men: they all lie in wait for blood; they hunt every man his brother with a net.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-33-007-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.33.007.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>That they may do evil with both hands earnestly, the prince asketh, and the judge asketh for a reward; and the great man, he uttereth his mischievous desire: so they wrap it up.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-33-007-004" data-verse-ref="KJV.33.007.004"><span class="verse-number">4</span>The best of them is as a brier: the most upright is sharper than a thorn hedge: the day of thy watchmen and thy visitation cometh; now shall be their perplexity.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-33-007-005" data-verse-ref="KJV.33.007.005"><span class="verse-number">5</span>Trust ye not in a friend, put ye not confidence in a guide: keep the doors of thy mouth from her that lieth in thy bosom.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-33-007-006" data-verse-ref="KJV.33.007.006"><span class="verse-number">6</span>For the son dishonoureth the father, the daughter riseth up against her mother, the daughter in law against her mother in law; a man's enemies are the men of his own house.</p>
