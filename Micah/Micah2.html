            <p class="verse" id="v-33-002-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.33.002.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>And they covet fields, and take them by violence; and houses, and take them away: so they oppress a man and his house, even a man and his heritage.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-33-002-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.33.002.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, against this family do I devise an evil, from which ye shall not remove your necks; neither shall ye go haughtily: for this time is evil.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-33-002-004" data-verse-ref="KJV.33.002.004"><span class="verse-number">4</span>In that day shall one take up a parable against you, and lament with a doleful lamentation, and say, We be utterly spoiled: he hath changed the portion of my people: how hath he removed it from me! turning away he hath divided our fields.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-33-002-005" data-verse-ref="KJV.33.002.005"><span class="verse-number">5</span>Therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast a cord by lot in the congregation of the LORD.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-33-002-008" data-verse-ref="KJV.33.002.008"><span class="verse-number">8</span>Even of late my people is risen up as an enemy: ye pull off the robe with the garment from them that pass by securely as men averse from war.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-33-002-009" data-verse-ref="KJV.33.002.009"><span class="verse-number">9</span>The women of my people have ye cast out from their pleasant houses; from their children have ye taken away my glory for ever.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-33-002-013" data-verse-ref="KJV.33.002.013"><span class="verse-number">13</span>The breaker is come up before them: they have broken up, and have passed through the gate, and are gone out by it: and their king shall pass before them, and the LORD on the head of them.</p>
