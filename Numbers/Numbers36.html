            <p class="verse" id="v-04-036-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.04.036.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>And they said, The LORD commanded my lord to give the land for an inheritance by lot to the children of Israel: and my lord was commanded by the LORD to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother unto his daughters.</p>
