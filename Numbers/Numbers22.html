            <p class="verse" id="v-04-022-017" data-verse-ref="KJV.04.022.017"><span class="verse-number">17</span>For I will promote thee unto very great honour, and I will do whatsoever thou sayest unto me: come therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-04-022-021" data-verse-ref="KJV.04.022.021"><span class="verse-number">21</span>And Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his ass, and went with the princes of Moab.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-04-022-022" data-verse-ref="KJV.04.022.022"><span class="verse-number">22</span>And God's anger was kindled because he went: and the angel of the LORD stood in the way for an adversary against him. Now he was riding upon his ass, and his two servants were with him.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-04-022-023" data-verse-ref="KJV.04.022.023"><span class="verse-number">23</span>And the ass saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and the ass turned aside out of the way, and went into the field: and Balaam smote the ass, to turn her into the way.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-04-022-024" data-verse-ref="KJV.04.022.024"><span class="verse-number">24</span>But the angel of the LORD stood in a path of the vineyards, a wall being on this side, and a wall on that side.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-04-022-025" data-verse-ref="KJV.04.022.025"><span class="verse-number">25</span>And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she thrust herself unto the wall, and crushed Balaam's foot against the wall: and he smote her again.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-04-022-026" data-verse-ref="KJV.04.022.026"><span class="verse-number">26</span>And the angel of the LORD went further, and stood in a narrow place, where was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-04-022-027" data-verse-ref="KJV.04.022.027"><span class="verse-number">27</span>And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she fell down under Balaam: and Balaam's anger was kindled, and he smote the ass with a staff.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-04-022-028" data-verse-ref="KJV.04.022.028"><span class="verse-number">28</span>And the LORD opened the mouth of the ass, and she said unto Balaam, What have I done unto thee, that thou hast smitten me these three times?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-04-022-029" data-verse-ref="KJV.04.022.029"><span class="verse-number">29</span>And Balaam said unto the ass, Because thou hast mocked me: I would there were a sword in mine hand, for now would I kill thee.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-04-022-030" data-verse-ref="KJV.04.022.030"><span class="verse-number">30</span>And the ass said unto Balaam, Am not I thine ass, upon which thou hast ridden ever since I was thine unto this day? was I ever wont to do so unto thee? And he said, Nay.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-04-022-031" data-verse-ref="KJV.04.022.031"><span class="verse-number">31</span>Then the LORD opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and he bowed down his head, and fell flat on his face.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-04-022-032" data-verse-ref="KJV.04.022.032"><span class="verse-number">32</span>And the angel of the LORD said unto him, Wherefore hast thou smitten thine ass these three times? behold, I went out to withstand thee, because thy way is perverse before me:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-04-022-033" data-verse-ref="KJV.04.022.033"><span class="verse-number">33</span>And the ass saw me, and turned from me these three times: unless she had turned from me, surely now also I had slain thee, and saved her alive.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-04-022-034" data-verse-ref="KJV.04.022.034"><span class="verse-number">34</span>And Balaam said unto the angel of the LORD, I have sinned; for I knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me: now therefore, if it displease thee, I will get me back again.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-04-022-035" data-verse-ref="KJV.04.022.035"><span class="verse-number">35</span>And the angel of the LORD said unto Balaam, Go with the men: but only the word that I shall speak unto thee, that thou shalt speak. So Balaam went with the princes of Balak.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-04-022-036" data-verse-ref="KJV.04.022.036"><span class="verse-number">36</span>And when Balak heard that Balaam was come, he went out to meet him unto a city of Moab, which is in the border of Arnon, which is in the utmost coast.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-04-022-037" data-verse-ref="KJV.04.022.037"><span class="verse-number">37</span>And Balak said unto Balaam, Did I not earnestly send unto thee to call thee? wherefore camest thou not unto me? am I not able indeed to promote thee to honour?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-04-022-038" data-verse-ref="KJV.04.022.038"><span class="verse-number">38</span>And Balaam said unto Balak, Lo, I am come unto thee: have I now any power at all to say any thing? the word that God putteth in my mouth, that shall I speak.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-04-022-039" data-verse-ref="KJV.04.022.039"><span class="verse-number">39</span>And Balaam went with Balak, and they came unto Kirjathhuzoth.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-04-022-040" data-verse-ref="KJV.04.022.040"><span class="verse-number">40</span>And Balak offered oxen and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to the princes that were with him.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-04-022-041" data-verse-ref="KJV.04.022.041"><span class="verse-number">41</span>And it came to pass on the morrow, that Balak took Balaam, and brought him up into the high places of Baal, that thence he might see the utmost part of the people.</p>
