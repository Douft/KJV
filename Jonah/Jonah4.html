            <p class="verse" id="v-32-004-001" data-verse-ref="KJV.32.004.001"><span class="verse-number">1</span>But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was very angry.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-32-004-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.32.004.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>And he prayed unto the LORD, and said, I pray thee, O LORD, was not this my saying, when I was yet in my country? Therefore I fled before unto Tarshish: for I knew that thou art a gracious God, and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repentest thee of the evil.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-32-004-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.32.004.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>Therefore now, O LORD, take, I beseech thee, my life from me; for it is better for me to die than to live.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-32-004-004" data-verse-ref="KJV.32.004.004"><span class="verse-number">4</span>Then said the LORD, Doest thou well to be angry?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-32-004-005" data-verse-ref="KJV.32.004.005"><span class="verse-number">5</span>So Jonah went out of the city, and sat on the east side of the city, and there made him a booth, and sat under it in the shadow, till he might see what would become of the city.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-32-004-006" data-verse-ref="KJV.32.004.006"><span class="verse-number">6</span>And the LORD God prepared a gourd, and made it to come up over Jonah, that it might be a shadow over his head, to deliver him from his grief. So Jonah was exceeding glad of the gourd.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-32-004-007" data-verse-ref="KJV.32.004.007"><span class="verse-number">7</span>But God prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day, and it smote the gourd that it withered.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-32-004-008" data-verse-ref="KJV.32.004.008"><span class="verse-number">8</span>And it came to pass, when the sun did arise, that God prepared a vehement east wind; and the sun beat upon the head of Jonah, that he fainted, and wished in himself to die, and said, It is better for me to die than to live.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-32-004-009" data-verse-ref="KJV.32.004.009"><span class="verse-number">9</span>And God said to Jonah, Doest thou well to be angry for the gourd? And he said, I do well to be angry, even unto death.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-32-004-010" data-verse-ref="KJV.32.004.010"><span class="verse-number">10</span>Then said the LORD, Thou hast had pity on the gourd, for the which thou hast not laboured, neither madest it grow; which came up in a night, and perished in a night:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-32-004-011" data-verse-ref="KJV.32.004.011"><span class="verse-number">11</span>And should not I spare Nineveh, that great city, wherein are more than sixscore thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand; and also much cattle?</p>
