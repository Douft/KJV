            <p class="verse" id="v-06-024-026" data-verse-ref="KJV.06.024.026"><span class="verse-number">26</span>And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God, and took a great stone, and set it up there under an oak, that was by the sanctuary of the LORD.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-06-024-027" data-verse-ref="KJV.06.024.027"><span class="verse-number">27</span>And Joshua said unto all the people, Behold, this stone shall be a witness unto us; for it hath heard all the words of the LORD which he spake unto us: it shall be therefore a witness unto you, lest ye deny your God.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-06-024-028" data-verse-ref="KJV.06.024.028"><span class="verse-number">28</span>So Joshua let the people depart, every man unto his inheritance.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-06-024-030" data-verse-ref="KJV.06.024.030"><span class="verse-number">30</span>And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnathserah, which is in mount Ephraim, on the north side of the hill of Gaash.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-06-024-031" data-verse-ref="KJV.06.024.031"><span class="verse-number">31</span>And Israel served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that overlived Joshua, and which had known all the works of the LORD, that he had done for Israel.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-06-024-032" data-verse-ref="KJV.06.024.032"><span class="verse-number">32</span>And the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought up out of Egypt, buried they in Shechem, in a parcel of ground which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for an hundred pieces of silver: and it became the inheritance of the children of Joseph.</p>
