            <p class="verse" id="v-06-006-006" data-verse-ref="KJV.06.006.006"><span class="verse-number">6</span>And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said unto them, Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the LORD.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-06-006-018" data-verse-ref="KJV.06.006.018"><span class="verse-number">18</span>And ye, in any wise keep yourselves from the accursed thing, lest ye make yourselves accursed, when ye take of the accursed thing, and make the camp of Israel a curse, and trouble it.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-06-006-019" data-verse-ref="KJV.06.006.019"><span class="verse-number">19</span>But all the silver, and gold, and vessels of brass and iron, are consecrated unto the LORD: they shall come into the treasury of the LORD.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-06-006-020" data-verse-ref="KJV.06.006.020"><span class="verse-number">20</span>So the people shouted when the priests blew with the trumpets: and it came to pass, when the people heard the sound of the trumpet, and the people shouted with a great shout, that the wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they took the city.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-06-006-021" data-verse-ref="KJV.06.006.021"><span class="verse-number">21</span>And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass, with the edge of the sword.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-06-006-022" data-verse-ref="KJV.06.006.022"><span class="verse-number">22</span>But Joshua had said unto the two men that had spied out the country, Go into the harlot's house, and bring out thence the woman, and all that she hath, as ye sware unto her.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-06-006-023" data-verse-ref="KJV.06.006.023"><span class="verse-number">23</span>And the young men that were spies went in, and brought out Rahab, and her father, and her mother, and her brethren, and all that she had; and they brought out all her kindred, and left them without the camp of Israel.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-06-006-024" data-verse-ref="KJV.06.006.024"><span class="verse-number">24</span>And they burnt the city with fire, and all that was therein: only the silver, and the gold, and the vessels of brass and of iron, they put into the treasury of the house of the LORD.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-06-006-025" data-verse-ref="KJV.06.006.025"><span class="verse-number">25</span>And Joshua saved Rahab the harlot alive, and her father's household, and all that she had; and she dwelleth in Israel even unto this day; because she hid the messengers, which Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-06-006-026" data-verse-ref="KJV.06.006.026"><span class="verse-number">26</span>And Joshua adjured them at that time, saying, Cursed be the man before the LORD, that riseth up and buildeth this city Jericho: he shall lay the foundation thereof in his firstborn, and in his youngest son shall he set up the gates of it.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-06-006-027" data-verse-ref="KJV.06.006.027"><span class="verse-number">27</span>So the LORD was with Joshua; and his fame was noised throughout all the country.</p>
