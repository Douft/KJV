            <p class="verse" id="v-06-009-021" data-verse-ref="KJV.06.009.021"><span class="verse-number">21</span>And the princes said unto them, Let them live; but let them be hewers of wood and drawers of water unto all the congregation; as the princes had promised them.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-06-009-022" data-verse-ref="KJV.06.009.022"><span class="verse-number">22</span>And Joshua called for them, and he spake unto them, saying, Wherefore have ye beguiled us, saying, We are very far from you; when ye dwell among us?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-06-009-023" data-verse-ref="KJV.06.009.023"><span class="verse-number">23</span>Now therefore ye are cursed, and there shall none of you be freed from being bondmen, and hewers of wood and drawers of water for the house of my God.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-06-009-024" data-verse-ref="KJV.06.009.024"><span class="verse-number">24</span>And they answered Joshua, and said, Because it was certainly told thy servants, how that the LORD thy God commanded his servant Moses to give you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you, therefore we were sore afraid of our lives because of you, and have done this thing.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-06-009-025" data-verse-ref="KJV.06.009.025"><span class="verse-number">25</span>And now, behold, we are in thine hand: as it seemeth good and right unto thee to do unto us, do.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-06-009-026" data-verse-ref="KJV.06.009.026"><span class="verse-number">26</span>And so did he unto them, and delivered them out of the hand of the children of Israel, that they slew them not.</p>
