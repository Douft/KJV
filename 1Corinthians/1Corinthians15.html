            <p class="verse" id="v-46-015-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.015.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-015-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.015.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-015-004" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.015.004"><span class="verse-number">4</span>And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-015-005" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.015.005"><span class="verse-number">5</span>And that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-015-006" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.015.006"><span class="verse-number">6</span>After that, he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once; of whom the greater part remain unto this present, but some are fallen asleep.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-015-007" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.015.007"><span class="verse-number">7</span>After that, he was seen of James; then of all the apostles.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-015-008" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.015.008"><span class="verse-number">8</span>And last of all he was seen of me also, as of one born out of due time.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-015-009" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.015.009"><span class="verse-number">9</span>For I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-015-010" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.015.010"><span class="verse-number">10</span>But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain; but I laboured more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-015-011" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.015.011"><span class="verse-number">11</span>Therefore whether it were I or they, so we preach, and so ye believed.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-46-015-014" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.015.014"><span class="verse-number">14</span>And if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-015-015" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.015.015"><span class="verse-number">15</span>Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God; because we have testified of God that he raised up Christ: whom he raised not up, if so be that the dead rise not.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-015-016" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.015.016"><span class="verse-number">16</span>For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised:</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-46-015-018" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.015.018"><span class="verse-number">18</span>Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-46-015-020" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.015.020"><span class="verse-number">20</span>But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the firstfruits of them that slept.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-015-021" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.015.021"><span class="verse-number">21</span>For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-015-022" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.015.022"><span class="verse-number">22</span>For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-015-023" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.015.023"><span class="verse-number">23</span>But every man in his own order: Christ the firstfruits; afterward they that are Christ's at his coming.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-015-024" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.015.024"><span class="verse-number">24</span>Then cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-015-025" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.015.025"><span class="verse-number">25</span>For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-46-015-027" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.015.027"><span class="verse-number">27</span>For he hath put all things under his feet. But when he saith, all things are put under him, it is manifest that he is excepted, which did put all things under him.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-015-028" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.015.028"><span class="verse-number">28</span>And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-015-029" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.015.029"><span class="verse-number">29</span>Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-015-030" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.015.030"><span class="verse-number">30</span>And why stand we in jeopardy every hour?</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-46-015-032" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.015.032"><span class="verse-number">32</span>If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus, what advantageth it me, if the dead rise not? let us eat and drink; for to morrow we die.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-015-033" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.015.033"><span class="verse-number">33</span>Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-46-015-035" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.015.035"><span class="verse-number">35</span>But some man will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what body do they come?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-015-036" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.015.036"><span class="verse-number">36</span>Thou fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-015-037" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.015.037"><span class="verse-number">37</span>And that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that shall be, but bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other grain:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-015-038" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.015.038"><span class="verse-number">38</span>But God giveth it a body as it hath pleased him, and to every seed his own body.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-46-015-040" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.015.040"><span class="verse-number">40</span>There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is another.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-015-041" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.015.041"><span class="verse-number">41</span>There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for one star differeth from another star in glory.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-015-042" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.015.042"><span class="verse-number">42</span>So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-015-043" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.015.043"><span class="verse-number">43</span>It is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-015-044" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.015.044"><span class="verse-number">44</span>It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-46-015-052" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.015.052"><span class="verse-number">52</span>In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-015-053" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.015.053"><span class="verse-number">53</span>For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-015-054" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.015.054"><span class="verse-number">54</span>So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.</p>
