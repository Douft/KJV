            <p class="verse" id="v-46-009-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.009.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>If I be not an apostle unto others, yet doubtless I am to you: for the seal of mine apostleship are ye in the Lord.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-009-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.009.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>Mine answer to them that do examine me is this,</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-009-004" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.009.004"><span class="verse-number">4</span>Have we not power to eat and to drink?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-009-005" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.009.005"><span class="verse-number">5</span>Have we not power to lead about a sister, a wife, as well as other apostles, and as the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-009-006" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.009.006"><span class="verse-number">6</span>Or I only and Barnabas, have not we power to forbear working?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-009-007" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.009.007"><span class="verse-number">7</span>Who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges? who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit thereof? or who feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-009-008" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.009.008"><span class="verse-number">8</span>Say I these things as a man? or saith not the law the same also?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-009-009" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.009.009"><span class="verse-number">9</span>For it is written in the law of Moses, Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn. Doth God take care for oxen?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-009-010" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.009.010"><span class="verse-number">10</span>Or saith he it altogether for our sakes? For our sakes, no doubt, this is written: that he that ploweth should plow in hope; and that he that thresheth in hope should be partaker of his hope.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-009-011" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.009.011"><span class="verse-number">11</span>If we have sown unto you spiritual things, is it a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things?</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-46-009-013" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.009.013"><span class="verse-number">13</span>Do ye not know that they which minister about holy things live of the things of the temple? and they which wait at the altar are partakers with the altar?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-009-014" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.009.014"><span class="verse-number">14</span>Even so hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-009-015" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.009.015"><span class="verse-number">15</span>But I have used none of these things: neither have I written these things, that it should be so done unto me: for it were better for me to die, than that any man should make my glorying void.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-009-016" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.009.016"><span class="verse-number">16</span>For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of: for necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel!</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-009-017" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.009.017"><span class="verse-number">17</span>For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward: but if against my will, a dispensation of the gospel is committed unto me.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-009-018" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.009.018"><span class="verse-number">18</span>What is my reward then? Verily that, when I preach the gospel, I may make the gospel of Christ without charge, that I abuse not my power in the gospel.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-009-019" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.009.019"><span class="verse-number">19</span>For though I be free from all men, yet have I made myself servant unto all, that I might gain the more.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-009-020" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.009.020"><span class="verse-number">20</span>And unto the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law;</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-009-021" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.009.021"><span class="verse-number">21</span>To them that are without law, as without law, (being not without law to God, but under the law to Christ,) that I might gain them that are without law.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-009-022" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.009.022"><span class="verse-number">22</span>To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak: I am made all things to all men, that I might by all means save some.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-009-023" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.009.023"><span class="verse-number">23</span>And this I do for the gospel's sake, that I might be partaker thereof with you.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-009-024" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.009.024"><span class="verse-number">24</span>Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may obtain.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-009-025" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.009.025"><span class="verse-number">25</span>And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-009-026" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.009.026"><span class="verse-number">26</span>I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one that beateth the air:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-009-027" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.009.027"><span class="verse-number">27</span>But I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway.</p>
