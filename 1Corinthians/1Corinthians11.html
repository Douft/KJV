            <p class="verse" id="v-46-011-001" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.011.001"><span class="verse-number">1</span>Be ye followers of me, even as I also am of Christ.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-011-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.011.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>Now I praise you, brethren, that ye remember me in all things, and keep the ordinances, as I delivered them to you.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-011-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.011.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-011-004" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.011.004"><span class="verse-number">4</span>Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonoureth his head.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-011-005" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.011.005"><span class="verse-number">5</span>But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonoureth her head: for that is even all one as if she were shaven.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-011-006" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.011.006"><span class="verse-number">6</span>For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn: but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-011-007" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.011.007"><span class="verse-number">7</span>For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-011-008" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.011.008"><span class="verse-number">8</span>For the man is not of the woman; but the woman of the man.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-011-009" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.011.009"><span class="verse-number">9</span>Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-011-010" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.011.010"><span class="verse-number">10</span>For this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the angels.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-011-011" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.011.011"><span class="verse-number">11</span>Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-011-012" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.011.012"><span class="verse-number">12</span>For as the woman is of the man, even so is the man also by the woman; but all things of God.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-011-013" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.011.013"><span class="verse-number">13</span>Judge in yourselves: is it comely that a woman pray unto God uncovered?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-011-014" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.011.014"><span class="verse-number">14</span>Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a shame unto him?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-011-015" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.011.015"><span class="verse-number">15</span>But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for her hair is given her for a covering.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-011-016" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.011.016"><span class="verse-number">16</span>But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-011-017" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.011.017"><span class="verse-number">17</span>Now in this that I declare unto you I praise you not, that ye come together not for the better, but for the worse.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-011-018" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.011.018"><span class="verse-number">18</span>For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear that there be divisions among you; and I partly believe it.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-011-019" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.011.019"><span class="verse-number">19</span>For there must be also heresies among you, that they which are approved may be made manifest among you.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-011-020" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.011.020"><span class="verse-number">20</span>When ye come together therefore into one place, this is not to eat the Lord's supper.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-011-021" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.011.021"><span class="verse-number">21</span>For in eating every one taketh before other his own supper: and one is hungry, and another is drunken.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-011-022" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.011.022"><span class="verse-number">22</span>What? have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise ye the church of God, and shame them that have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise you not.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-011-023" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.011.023"><span class="verse-number">23</span>For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-011-024" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.011.024"><span class="verse-number">24</span>And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-011-025" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.011.025"><span class="verse-number">25</span>After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-011-026" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.011.026"><span class="verse-number">26</span>For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord's death till he come.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-011-027" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.011.027"><span class="verse-number">27</span>Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-011-028" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.011.028"><span class="verse-number">28</span>But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-011-029" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.011.029"><span class="verse-number">29</span>For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-011-030" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.011.030"><span class="verse-number">30</span>For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-011-031" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.011.031"><span class="verse-number">31</span>For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-011-032" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.011.032"><span class="verse-number">32</span>But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-011-033" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.011.033"><span class="verse-number">33</span>Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one for another.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-011-034" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.011.034"><span class="verse-number">34</span>And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that ye come not together unto condemnation. And the rest will I set in order when I come.</p>
