            <p class="verse" id="v-46-012-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.012.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried away unto these dumb idols, even as ye were led.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-012-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.012.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed: and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-012-004" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.012.004"><span class="verse-number">4</span>Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-012-005" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.012.005"><span class="verse-number">5</span>And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-012-006" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.012.006"><span class="verse-number">6</span>And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in all.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-012-007" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.012.007"><span class="verse-number">7</span>But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-012-008" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.012.008"><span class="verse-number">8</span>For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-012-009" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.012.009"><span class="verse-number">9</span>To another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit;</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-46-012-011" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.012.011"><span class="verse-number">11</span>But all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-012-012" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.012.012"><span class="verse-number">12</span>For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is Christ.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-012-013" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.012.013"><span class="verse-number">13</span>For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-012-014" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.012.014"><span class="verse-number">14</span>For the body is not one member, but many.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-46-012-017" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.012.017"><span class="verse-number">17</span>If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where were the smelling?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-012-018" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.012.018"><span class="verse-number">18</span>But now hath God set the members every one of them in the body, as it hath pleased him.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-012-019" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.012.019"><span class="verse-number">19</span>And if they were all one member, where were the body?</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-46-012-021" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.012.021"><span class="verse-number">21</span>And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-012-022" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.012.022"><span class="verse-number">22</span>Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be more feeble, are necessary:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-012-023" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.012.023"><span class="verse-number">23</span>And those members of the body, which we think to be less honourable, upon these we bestow more abundant honour; and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-012-024" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.012.024"><span class="verse-number">24</span>For our comely parts have no need: but God hath tempered the body together, having given more abundant honour to that part which lacked:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-012-025" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.012.025"><span class="verse-number">25</span>That there should be no schism in the body; but that the members should have the same care one for another.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-012-026" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.012.026"><span class="verse-number">26</span>And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-012-027" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.012.027"><span class="verse-number">27</span>Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-012-028" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.012.028"><span class="verse-number">28</span>And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-012-029" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.012.029"><span class="verse-number">29</span>Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all workers of miracles?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-012-030" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.012.030"><span class="verse-number">30</span>Have all the gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret?</p>
