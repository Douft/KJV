            <p class="verse" id="v-46-005-001" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.005.001"><span class="verse-number">1</span>It is reported commonly that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that one should have his father's wife.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-005-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.005.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>And ye are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-005-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.005.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>For I verily, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have judged already, as though I were present, concerning him that hath so done this deed,</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-005-004" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.005.004"><span class="verse-number">4</span>In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when ye are gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-005-005" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.005.005"><span class="verse-number">5</span>To deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-005-006" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.005.006"><span class="verse-number">6</span>Your glorying is not good. Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-005-007" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.005.007"><span class="verse-number">7</span>Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-005-008" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.005.008"><span class="verse-number">8</span>Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-005-009" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.005.009"><span class="verse-number">9</span>I wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-005-010" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.005.010"><span class="verse-number">10</span>Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must ye needs go out of the world.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-005-011" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.005.011"><span class="verse-number">11</span>But now I have written unto you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such an one no not to eat.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-005-012" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.005.012"><span class="verse-number">12</span>For what have I to do to judge them also that are without? do not ye judge them that are within?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-46-005-013" data-verse-ref="KJV.46.005.013"><span class="verse-number">13</span>But them that are without God judgeth. Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person.</p>
