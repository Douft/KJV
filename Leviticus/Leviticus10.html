            <p class="verse" id="v-03-010-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.03.010.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>And there went out fire from the LORD, and devoured them, and they died before the LORD.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-03-010-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.03.010.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>Then Moses said unto Aaron, This is it that the LORD spake, saying, I will be sanctified in them that come nigh me, and before all the people I will be glorified. And Aaron held his peace.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-03-010-004" data-verse-ref="KJV.03.010.004"><span class="verse-number">4</span>And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron, and said unto them, Come near, carry your brethren from before the sanctuary out of the camp.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-03-010-005" data-verse-ref="KJV.03.010.005"><span class="verse-number">5</span>So they went near, and carried them in their coats out of the camp; as Moses had said.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-03-010-006" data-verse-ref="KJV.03.010.006"><span class="verse-number">6</span>And Moses said unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his sons, Uncover not your heads, neither rend your clothes; lest ye die, and lest wrath come upon all the people: but let your brethren, the whole house of Israel, bewail the burning which the LORD hath kindled.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-03-010-007" data-verse-ref="KJV.03.010.007"><span class="verse-number">7</span>And ye shall not go out from the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, lest ye die: for the anointing oil of the LORD is upon you. And they did according to the word of Moses.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-03-010-008" data-verse-ref="KJV.03.010.008"><span class="verse-number">8</span>And the LORD spake unto Aaron, saying,</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-03-010-013" data-verse-ref="KJV.03.010.013"><span class="verse-number">13</span>And ye shall eat it in the holy place, because it is thy due, and thy sons' due, of the sacrifices of the LORD made by fire: for so I am commanded.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-03-010-014" data-verse-ref="KJV.03.010.014"><span class="verse-number">14</span>And the wave breast and heave shoulder shall ye eat in a clean place; thou, and thy sons, and thy daughters with thee: for they be thy due, and thy sons' due, which are given out of the sacrifices of peace offerings of the children of Israel.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-03-010-015" data-verse-ref="KJV.03.010.015"><span class="verse-number">15</span>The heave shoulder and the wave breast shall they bring with the offerings made by fire of the fat, to wave it for a wave offering before the LORD; and it shall be thine, and thy sons' with thee, by a statute for ever; as the LORD hath commanded.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-03-010-016" data-verse-ref="KJV.03.010.016"><span class="verse-number">16</span>And Moses diligently sought the goat of the sin offering, and, behold, it was burnt: and he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, the sons of Aaron which were left alive, saying,</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-03-010-017" data-verse-ref="KJV.03.010.017"><span class="verse-number">17</span>Wherefore have ye not eaten the sin offering in the holy place, seeing it is most holy, and God hath given it you to bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for them before the LORD?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-03-010-018" data-verse-ref="KJV.03.010.018"><span class="verse-number">18</span>Behold, the blood of it was not brought in within the holy place: ye should indeed have eaten it in the holy place, as I commanded.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-03-010-019" data-verse-ref="KJV.03.010.019"><span class="verse-number">19</span>And Aaron said unto Moses, Behold, this day have they offered their sin offering and their burnt offering before the LORD; and such things have befallen me: and if I had eaten the sin offering to day, should it have been accepted in the sight of the LORD?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-03-010-020" data-verse-ref="KJV.03.010.020"><span class="verse-number">20</span>And when Moses heard that, he was content.</p>
