            <p class="verse" id="v-23-030-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.23.030.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>That walk to go down into Egypt, and have not asked at my mouth; to strengthen themselves in the strength of Pharaoh, and to trust in the shadow of Egypt!</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-23-030-027" data-verse-ref="KJV.23.030.027"><span class="verse-number">27</span>Behold, the name of the LORD cometh from far, burning with his anger, and the burden thereof is heavy: his lips are full of indignation, and his tongue as a devouring fire:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-23-030-028" data-verse-ref="KJV.23.030.028"><span class="verse-number">28</span>And his breath, as an overflowing stream, shall reach to the midst of the neck, to sift the nations with the sieve of vanity: and there shall be a bridle in the jaws of the people, causing them to err.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-23-030-029" data-verse-ref="KJV.23.030.029"><span class="verse-number">29</span>Ye shall have a song, as in the night when a holy solemnity is kept; and gladness of heart, as when one goeth with a pipe to come into the mountain of the LORD, to the mighty One of Israel.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-23-030-030" data-verse-ref="KJV.23.030.030"><span class="verse-number">30</span>And the LORD shall cause his glorious voice to be heard, and shall shew the lighting down of his arm, with the indignation of his anger, and with the flame of a devouring fire, with scattering, and tempest, and hailstones.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-23-030-031" data-verse-ref="KJV.23.030.031"><span class="verse-number">31</span>For through the voice of the LORD shall the Assyrian be beaten down, which smote with a rod.</p>
