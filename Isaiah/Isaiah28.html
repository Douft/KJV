            <p class="verse" id="v-23-028-020" data-verse-ref="KJV.23.028.020"><span class="verse-number">20</span>For the bed is shorter than that a man can stretch himself on it: and the covering narrower than that he can wrap himself in it.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-23-028-021" data-verse-ref="KJV.23.028.021"><span class="verse-number">21</span>For the LORD shall rise up as in mount Perazim, he shall be wroth as in the valley of Gibeon, that he may do his work, his strange work; and bring to pass his act, his strange act.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-23-028-022" data-verse-ref="KJV.23.028.022"><span class="verse-number">22</span>Now therefore be ye not mockers, lest your bands be made strong: for I have heard from the Lord GOD of hosts a consumption, even determined upon the whole earth.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-23-028-027" data-verse-ref="KJV.23.028.027"><span class="verse-number">27</span>For the fitches are not threshed with a threshing instrument, neither is a cart wheel turned about upon the cummin; but the fitches are beaten out with a staff, and the cummin with a rod.</p>
