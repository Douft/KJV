            <p class="verse" id="v-23-006-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.23.006.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>Above it stood the seraphims: each one had six wings; with twain he covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet, and with twain he did fly.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-23-006-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.23.006.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is the LORD of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-23-006-004" data-verse-ref="KJV.23.006.004"><span class="verse-number">4</span>And the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried, and the house was filled with smoke.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-23-006-005" data-verse-ref="KJV.23.006.005"><span class="verse-number">5</span>Then said I, Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips: for mine eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-23-006-006" data-verse-ref="KJV.23.006.006"><span class="verse-number">6</span>Then flew one of the seraphims unto me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-23-006-007" data-verse-ref="KJV.23.006.007"><span class="verse-number">7</span>And he laid it upon my mouth, and said, Lo, this hath touched thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin purged.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-23-006-008" data-verse-ref="KJV.23.006.008"><span class="verse-number">8</span>Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then said I, Here am I; send me.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-23-006-009" data-verse-ref="KJV.23.006.009"><span class="verse-number">9</span>And he said, Go, and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but understand not; and see ye indeed, but perceive not.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-23-006-010" data-verse-ref="KJV.23.006.010"><span class="verse-number">10</span>Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and convert, and be healed.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-23-006-011" data-verse-ref="KJV.23.006.011"><span class="verse-number">11</span>Then said I, Lord, how long? And he answered, Until the cities be wasted without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the land be utterly desolate,</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-23-006-012" data-verse-ref="KJV.23.006.012"><span class="verse-number">12</span>And the LORD have removed men far away, and there be a great forsaking in the midst of the land.</p>
