            <p class="verse" id="v-23-025-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.23.025.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>For thou hast made of a city an heap; of a defenced city a ruin: a palace of strangers to be no city; it shall never be built.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-23-025-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.23.025.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>Therefore shall the strong people glorify thee, the city of the terrible nations shall fear thee.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-23-025-004" data-verse-ref="KJV.23.025.004"><span class="verse-number">4</span>For thou hast been a strength to the poor, a strength to the needy in his distress, a refuge from the storm, a shadow from the heat, when the blast of the terrible ones is as a storm against the wall.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-23-025-005" data-verse-ref="KJV.23.025.005"><span class="verse-number">5</span>Thou shalt bring down the noise of strangers, as the heat in a dry place; even the heat with the shadow of a cloud: the branch of the terrible ones shall be brought low.</p>
