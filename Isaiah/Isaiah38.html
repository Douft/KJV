            <p class="verse" id="v-23-038-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.23.038.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>Then Hezekiah turned his face toward the wall, and prayed unto the LORD,</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-23-038-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.23.038.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>And said, Remember now, O LORD, I beseech thee, how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thy sight. And Hezekiah wept sore.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-23-038-004" data-verse-ref="KJV.23.038.004"><span class="verse-number">4</span>Then came the word of the LORD to Isaiah, saying,</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-23-038-005" data-verse-ref="KJV.23.038.005"><span class="verse-number">5</span>Go, and say to Hezekiah, Thus saith the LORD, the God of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears: behold, I will add unto thy days fifteen years.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-23-038-006" data-verse-ref="KJV.23.038.006"><span class="verse-number">6</span>And I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria: and I will defend this city.</p>

So the sun returned ten degrees, by which degrees it was gone down.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-23-038-011" data-verse-ref="KJV.23.038.011"><span class="verse-number">11</span>I said, I shall not see the LORD, even the LORD, in the land of the living: I shall behold man no more with the inhabitants of the world.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-23-038-016" data-verse-ref="KJV.23.038.016"><span class="verse-number">16</span>O Lord, by these things men live, and in all these things is the life of my spirit: so wilt thou recover me, and make me to live.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-23-038-017" data-verse-ref="KJV.23.038.017"><span class="verse-number">17</span>Behold, for peace I had great bitterness: but thou hast in love to my soul delivered it from the pit of corruption: for thou hast cast all my sins behind thy back.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-23-038-018" data-verse-ref="KJV.23.038.018"><span class="verse-number">18</span>For the grave cannot praise thee, death can not celebrate thee: they that go down into the pit cannot hope for thy truth.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-23-038-021" data-verse-ref="KJV.23.038.021"><span class="verse-number">21</span>For Isaiah had said, Let them take a lump of figs, and lay it for a plaister upon the boil, and he shall recover.</p>
