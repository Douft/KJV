            <p class="verse" id="v-23-007-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.23.007.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>And it was told the house of David, saying, Syria is confederate with Ephraim. And his heart was moved, and the heart of his people, as the trees of the wood are moved with the wind.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-23-007-004" data-verse-ref="KJV.23.007.004"><span class="verse-number">4</span>And say unto him, Take heed, and be quiet; fear not, neither be fainthearted for the two tails of these smoking firebrands, for the fierce anger of Rezin with Syria, and of the son of Remaliah.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-23-007-005" data-verse-ref="KJV.23.007.005"><span class="verse-number">5</span>Because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah, have taken evil counsel against thee, saying,</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-23-007-006" data-verse-ref="KJV.23.007.006"><span class="verse-number">6</span>Let us go up against Judah, and vex it, and let us make a breach therein for us, and set a king in the midst of it, even the son of Tabeal:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-23-007-007" data-verse-ref="KJV.23.007.007"><span class="verse-number">7</span>Thus saith the Lord GOD, It shall not stand, neither shall it come to pass.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-23-007-008" data-verse-ref="KJV.23.007.008"><span class="verse-number">8</span>For the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rezin; and within threescore and five years shall Ephraim be broken, that it be not a people.</p>
