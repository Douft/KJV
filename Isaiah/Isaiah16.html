            <p class="verse" id="v-23-016-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.23.016.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>For it shall be, that, as a wandering bird cast out of the nest, so the daughters of Moab shall be at the fords of Arnon.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-23-016-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.23.016.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>Take counsel, execute judgment; make thy shadow as the night in the midst of the noonday; hide the outcasts; bewray not him that wandereth.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-23-016-009" data-verse-ref="KJV.23.016.009"><span class="verse-number">9</span>Therefore I will bewail with the weeping of Jazer the vine of Sibmah: I will water thee with my tears, O Heshbon, and Elealeh: for the shouting for thy summer fruits and for thy harvest is fallen.</p>
