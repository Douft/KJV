Behold, for your iniquities have ye sold yourselves, and for your transgressions is your mother put away.</p>

Is my hand shortened at all, that it cannot redeem? or have I no power to deliver? behold, at my rebuke I dry up the sea, I make the rivers a wilderness: their fish stinketh, because there is no water, and dieth for thirst.</p>
