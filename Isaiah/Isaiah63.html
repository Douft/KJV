I that speak in righteousness, mighty to save.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-23-063-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.23.063.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>Wherefore art thou red in thine apparel, and thy garments like him that treadeth in the winefat?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-23-063-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.23.063.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>I have trodden the winepress alone; and of the people there was none with me: for I will tread them in mine anger, and trample them in my fury; and their blood shall be sprinkled upon my garments, and I will stain all my raiment.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-23-063-004" data-verse-ref="KJV.23.063.004"><span class="verse-number">4</span>For the day of vengeance is in mine heart, and the year of my redeemed is come.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-23-063-005" data-verse-ref="KJV.23.063.005"><span class="verse-number">5</span>And I looked, and there was none to help; and I wondered that there was none to uphold: therefore mine own arm brought salvation unto me; and my fury, it upheld me.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-23-063-006" data-verse-ref="KJV.23.063.006"><span class="verse-number">6</span>And I will tread down the people in mine anger, and make them drunk in my fury, and I will bring down their strength to the earth.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-23-063-008" data-verse-ref="KJV.23.063.008"><span class="verse-number">8</span>For he said, Surely they are my people, children that will not lie: so he was their Saviour.</p>
