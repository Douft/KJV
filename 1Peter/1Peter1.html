            <p class="verse" id="v-60-001-023" data-verse-ref="KJV.60.001.023"><span class="verse-number">23</span>Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-60-001-024" data-verse-ref="KJV.60.001.024"><span class="verse-number">24</span>For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass. The grass withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away:</p>
