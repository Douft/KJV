            <p class="verse" id="v-01-020-001" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.020.001"><span class="verse-number">1</span>And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country, and dwelled between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-01-020-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.020.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister: and Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-01-020-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.020.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him, Behold, thou art but a dead man, for the woman which thou hast taken; for she is a man's wife.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-01-020-004" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.020.004"><span class="verse-number">4</span>But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, Lord, wilt thou slay also a righteous nation?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-01-020-005" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.020.005"><span class="verse-number">5</span>Said he not unto me, She is my sister? and she, even she herself said, He is my brother: in the integrity of my heart and innocency of my hands have I done this.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-01-020-006" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.020.006"><span class="verse-number">6</span>And God said unto him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart; for I also withheld thee from sinning against me: therefore suffered I thee not to touch her.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-01-020-007" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.020.007"><span class="verse-number">7</span>Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that are thine.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-01-020-008" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.020.008"><span class="verse-number">8</span>Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were sore afraid.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-01-020-009" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.020.009"><span class="verse-number">9</span>Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-01-020-010" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.020.010"><span class="verse-number">10</span>And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou hast done this thing?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-01-020-011" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.020.011"><span class="verse-number">11</span>And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God is not in this place; and they will slay me for my wife's sake.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-01-020-012" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.020.012"><span class="verse-number">12</span>And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-01-020-013" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.020.013"><span class="verse-number">13</span>And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness which thou shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me, He is my brother.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-01-020-014" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.020.014"><span class="verse-number">14</span>And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and womenservants, and gave them unto Abraham, and restored him Sarah his wife.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-01-020-015" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.020.015"><span class="verse-number">15</span>And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before thee: dwell where it pleaseth thee.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-01-020-016" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.020.016"><span class="verse-number">16</span>And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to thee a covering of the eyes, unto all that are with thee, and with all other: thus she was reproved.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-01-020-017" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.020.017"><span class="verse-number">17</span>So Abraham prayed unto God: and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maidservants; and they bare children.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-01-020-018" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.020.018"><span class="verse-number">18</span>For the LORD had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah Abraham's wife.</p>
