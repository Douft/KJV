            <p class="verse" id="v-01-019-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.019.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on your ways. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-01-019-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.019.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-01-019-004" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.019.004"><span class="verse-number">4</span>But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from every quarter:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-01-019-005" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.019.005"><span class="verse-number">5</span>And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-01-019-006" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.019.006"><span class="verse-number">6</span>And Lot went out at the door unto them, and shut the door after him,</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-01-019-007" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.019.007"><span class="verse-number">7</span>And said, I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-01-019-008" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.019.008"><span class="verse-number">8</span>Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-01-019-009" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.019.009"><span class="verse-number">9</span>And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man, even Lot, and came near to break the door.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-01-019-010" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.019.010"><span class="verse-number">10</span>But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-01-019-013" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.019.013"><span class="verse-number">13</span>For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the LORD; and the LORD hath sent us to destroy it.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-01-019-014" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.019.014"><span class="verse-number">14</span>And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the LORD will destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in law.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-01-019-015" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.019.015"><span class="verse-number">15</span>And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-01-019-016" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.019.016"><span class="verse-number">16</span>And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the LORD being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the city.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-01-019-017" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.019.017"><span class="verse-number">17</span>And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-01-019-018" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.019.018"><span class="verse-number">18</span>And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my Lord:</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-01-019-020" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.019.020"><span class="verse-number">20</span>Behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one: Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and my soul shall live.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-01-019-021" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.019.021"><span class="verse-number">21</span>And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which thou hast spoken.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-01-019-022" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.019.022"><span class="verse-number">22</span>Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do any thing till thou be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-01-019-023" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.019.023"><span class="verse-number">23</span>The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-01-019-024" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.019.024"><span class="verse-number">24</span>Then the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the LORD out of heaven;</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-01-019-029" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.019.029"><span class="verse-number">29</span>And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt.</p>
