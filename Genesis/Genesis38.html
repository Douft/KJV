And she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest come in unto me?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-01-038-017" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.038.017"><span class="verse-number">17</span>And he said, I will send thee a kid from the flock. And she said, Wilt thou give me a pledge, till thou send it?</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-01-038-021" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.038.021"><span class="verse-number">21</span>Then he asked the men of that place, saying, Where is the harlot, that was openly by the way side? And they said, There was no harlot in this place.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-01-038-022" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.038.022"><span class="verse-number">22</span>And he returned to Judah, and said, I cannot find her; and also the men of the place said, that there was no harlot in this place.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-01-038-023" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.038.023"><span class="verse-number">23</span>And Judah said, Let her take it to her, lest we be shamed: behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-01-038-024" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.038.024"><span class="verse-number">24</span>And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot; and also, behold, she is with child by whoredom. And Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-01-038-025" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.038.025"><span class="verse-number">25</span>When she was brought forth, she sent to her father in law, saying, By the man, whose these are, am I with child: and she said, Discern, I pray thee, whose are these, the signet, and bracelets, and staff.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-01-038-026" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.038.026"><span class="verse-number">26</span>And Judah acknowledged them, and said, She hath been more righteous than I; because that I gave her not to Shelah my son. And he knew her again no more.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-01-038-027" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.038.027"><span class="verse-number">27</span>And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold, twins were in her womb.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-01-038-028" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.038.028"><span class="verse-number">28</span>And it came to pass, when she travailed, that the one put out his hand: and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread, saying, This came out first.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-01-038-029" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.038.029"><span class="verse-number">29</span>And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold, his brother came out: and she said, How hast thou broken forth? this breach be upon thee: therefore his name was called Pharez.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-01-038-030" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.038.030"><span class="verse-number">30</span>And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet thread upon his hand: and his name was called Zarah.</p>
