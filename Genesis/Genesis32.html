            <p class="verse" id="v-01-032-020" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.032.020"><span class="verse-number">20</span>And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us.

            <p class="verse" id="v-01-032-022" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.032.022"><span class="verse-number">22</span>And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two womenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford Jabbok.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-01-032-023" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.032.023"><span class="verse-number">23</span>And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over that he had.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-01-032-024" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.032.024"><span class="verse-number">24</span>And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-01-032-025" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.032.025"><span class="verse-number">25</span>And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint, as he wrestled with him.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-01-032-026" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.032.026"><span class="verse-number">26</span>And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless me.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-01-032-027" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.032.027"><span class="verse-number">27</span>And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-01-032-028" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.032.028"><span class="verse-number">28</span>And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-01-032-029" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.032.029"><span class="verse-number">29</span>And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name. And he said, Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name? And he blessed him there.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-01-032-030" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.032.030"><span class="verse-number">30</span>And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-01-032-031" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.032.031"><span class="verse-number">31</span>And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he halted upon his thigh.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-01-032-032" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.032.032"><span class="verse-number">32</span>Therefore the children of Israel eat not of the sinew which shrank, which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day: because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew that shrank.</p>
