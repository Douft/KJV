            <p class="verse" id="v-01-043-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.043.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>And Judah spake unto him, saying, The man did solemnly protest unto us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-01-043-021" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.043.021"><span class="verse-number">21</span>And it came to pass, when we came to the inn, that we opened our sacks, and, behold, every man's money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight: and we have brought it again in our hand.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-01-043-022" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.043.022"><span class="verse-number">22</span>And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food: we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-01-043-023" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.043.023"><span class="verse-number">23</span>And he said, Peace be to you, fear not: your God, and the God of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks: I had your money. And he brought Simeon out unto them.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-01-043-024" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.043.024"><span class="verse-number">24</span>And the man brought the men into Joseph's house, and gave them water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their asses provender.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-01-043-025" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.043.025"><span class="verse-number">25</span>And they made ready the present against Joseph came at noon: for they heard that they should eat bread there.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-01-043-026" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.043.026"><span class="verse-number">26</span>And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves to him to the earth.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-01-043-027" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.043.027"><span class="verse-number">27</span>And he asked them of their welfare, and said, Is your father well, the old man of whom ye spake? Is he yet alive?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-01-043-028" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.043.028"><span class="verse-number">28</span>And they answered, Thy servant our father is in good health, he is yet alive. And they bowed down their heads, and made obeisance.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-01-043-029" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.043.029"><span class="verse-number">29</span>And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother's son, and said, Is this your younger brother, of whom ye spake unto me? And he said, God be gracious unto thee, my son.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-01-043-030" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.043.030"><span class="verse-number">30</span>And Joseph made haste; for his bowels did yearn upon his brother: and he sought where to weep; and he entered into his chamber, and wept there.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-01-043-031" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.043.031"><span class="verse-number">31</span>And he washed his face, and went out, and refrained himself, and said, Set on bread.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-01-043-032" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.043.032"><span class="verse-number">32</span>And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians, which did eat with him, by themselves: because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that is an abomination unto the Egyptians.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-01-043-033" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.043.033"><span class="verse-number">33</span>And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth: and the men marvelled one at another.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-01-043-034" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.043.034"><span class="verse-number">34</span>And he took and sent messes unto them from before him: but Benjamin's mess was five times so much as any of theirs. And they drank, and were merry with him.</p>
