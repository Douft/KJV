            <p class="verse" id="v-01-042-022" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.042.022"><span class="verse-number">22</span>And Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not unto you, saying, Do not sin against the child; and ye would not hear? therefore, behold, also his blood is required.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-01-042-023" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.042.023"><span class="verse-number">23</span>And they knew not that Joseph understood them; for he spake unto them by an interpreter.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-01-042-024" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.042.024"><span class="verse-number">24</span>And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and returned to them again, and communed with them, and took from them Simeon, and bound him before their eyes.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-01-042-025" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.042.025"><span class="verse-number">25</span>Then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn, and to restore every man's money into his sack, and to give them provision for the way: and thus did he unto them.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-01-042-026" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.042.026"><span class="verse-number">26</span>And they laded their asses with the corn, and departed thence.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-01-042-027" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.042.027"><span class="verse-number">27</span>And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the inn, he espied his money; for, behold, it was in his sack's mouth.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-01-042-028" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.042.028"><span class="verse-number">28</span>And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo, it is even in my sack: and their heart failed them, and they were afraid, saying one to another, What is this that God hath done unto us?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-01-042-029" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.042.029"><span class="verse-number">29</span>And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan, and told him all that befell unto them; saying,</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-01-042-031" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.042.031"><span class="verse-number">31</span>And we said unto him, We are true men; we are no spies:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-01-042-032" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.042.032"><span class="verse-number">32</span>We be twelve brethren, sons of our father; one is not, and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-01-042-033" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.042.033"><span class="verse-number">33</span>And the man, the lord of the country, said unto us, Hereby shall I know that ye are true men; leave one of your brethren here with me, and take food for the famine of your households, and be gone:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-01-042-034" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.042.034"><span class="verse-number">34</span>And bring your youngest brother unto me: then shall I know that ye are no spies, but that ye are true men: so will I deliver you your brother, and ye shall traffick in the land.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-01-042-035" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.042.035"><span class="verse-number">35</span>And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold, every man's bundle of money was in his sack: and when both they and their father saw the bundles of money, they were afraid.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-01-042-036" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.042.036"><span class="verse-number">36</span>And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved of my children: Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will take Benjamin away: all these things are against me.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-01-042-037" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.042.037"><span class="verse-number">37</span>And Reuben spake unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I bring him not to thee: deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him to thee again.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-01-042-038" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.042.038"><span class="verse-number">38</span>And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he is left alone: if mischief befall him by the way in the which ye go, then shall ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.</p>
