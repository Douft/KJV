            <p class="verse" id="v-01-018-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.018.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground,</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-01-018-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.018.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>And said, My Lord, if now I have found favour in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant:</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-01-018-005" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.018.005"><span class="verse-number">5</span>And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort ye your hearts; after that ye shall pass on: for therefore are ye come to your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-01-018-006" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.018.006"><span class="verse-number">6</span>And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes upon the hearth.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-01-018-007" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.018.007"><span class="verse-number">7</span>And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetcht a calf tender and good, and gave it unto a young man; and he hasted to dress it.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-01-018-008" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.018.008"><span class="verse-number">8</span>And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-01-018-009" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.018.009"><span class="verse-number">9</span>And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-01-018-013" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.018.013"><span class="verse-number">13</span>And the LORD said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, which am old?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-01-018-014" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.018.014"><span class="verse-number">14</span>Is any thing too hard for the LORD? At the time appointed I will return unto thee, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-01-018-025" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.018.025"><span class="verse-number">25</span>That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-01-018-026" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.018.026"><span class="verse-number">26</span>And the LORD said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-01-018-029" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.018.029"><span class="verse-number">29</span>And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for forty's sake.</p>
