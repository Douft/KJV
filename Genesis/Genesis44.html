            <p class="verse" id="v-01-044-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.044.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack's mouth of the youngest, and his corn money. And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-01-044-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.044.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their asses.</p>

God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants: behold, we are my lord's servants, both we, and he also with whom the cup is found.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-01-044-017" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.044.017"><span class="verse-number">17</span>And he said, God forbid that I should do so: but the man in whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant; and as for you, get you up in peace unto your father.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-01-044-018" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.044.018"><span class="verse-number">18</span>Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not thine anger burn against thy servant: for thou art even as Pharaoh.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-01-044-021" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.044.021"><span class="verse-number">21</span>And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me, that I may set mine eyes upon him.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-01-044-022" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.044.022"><span class="verse-number">22</span>And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father: for if he should leave his father, his father would die.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-01-044-023" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.044.023"><span class="verse-number">23</span>And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest brother come down with you, ye shall see my face no more.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-01-044-024" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.044.024"><span class="verse-number">24</span>And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father, we told him the words of my lord.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-01-044-025" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.044.025"><span class="verse-number">25</span>And our father said, Go again, and buy us a little food.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-01-044-026" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.044.026"><span class="verse-number">26</span>And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be with us, then will we go down: for we may not see the man's face, except our youngest brother be with us.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-01-044-027" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.044.027"><span class="verse-number">27</span>And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife bare me two sons:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-01-044-028" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.044.028"><span class="verse-number">28</span>And the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in pieces; and I saw him not since:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-01-044-029" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.044.029"><span class="verse-number">29</span>And if ye take this also from me, and mischief befall him, ye shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-01-044-030" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.044.030"><span class="verse-number">30</span>Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad be not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad's life;</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-01-044-031" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.044.031"><span class="verse-number">31</span>It shall come to pass, when he seeth that the lad is not with us, that he will die: and thy servants shall bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-01-044-032" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.044.032"><span class="verse-number">32</span>For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father, saying, If I bring him not unto thee, then I shall bear the blame to my father for ever.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-01-044-033" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.044.033"><span class="verse-number">33</span>Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-01-044-034" data-verse-ref="KJV.01.044.034"><span class="verse-number">34</span>For how shall I go up to my father, and the lad be not with me? lest peradventure I see the evil that shall come on my father.</p>
