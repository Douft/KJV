            <p class="verse" id="v-58-007-001" data-verse-ref="KJV.58.007.001"><span class="verse-number">1</span>For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him;</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-58-007-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.58.007.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all; first being by interpretation King of righteousness, and after that also King of Salem, which is, King of peace;</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-58-007-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.58.007.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>Without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but made like unto the Son of God; abideth a priest continually.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-58-007-004" data-verse-ref="KJV.58.007.004"><span class="verse-number">4</span>Now consider how great this man was, unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-58-007-005" data-verse-ref="KJV.58.007.005"><span class="verse-number">5</span>And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though they come out of the loins of Abraham:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-58-007-006" data-verse-ref="KJV.58.007.006"><span class="verse-number">6</span>But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-58-007-007" data-verse-ref="KJV.58.007.007"><span class="verse-number">7</span>And without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-58-007-008" data-verse-ref="KJV.58.007.008"><span class="verse-number">8</span>And here men that die receive tithes; but there he receiveth them, of whom it is witnessed that he liveth.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-58-007-009" data-verse-ref="KJV.58.007.009"><span class="verse-number">9</span>And as I may so say, Levi also, who receiveth tithes, payed tithes in Abraham.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-58-007-010" data-verse-ref="KJV.58.007.010"><span class="verse-number">10</span>For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedec met him.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-58-007-011" data-verse-ref="KJV.58.007.011"><span class="verse-number">11</span>If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what further need was there that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-58-007-012" data-verse-ref="KJV.58.007.012"><span class="verse-number">12</span>For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-58-007-013" data-verse-ref="KJV.58.007.013"><span class="verse-number">13</span>For he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe, of which no man gave attendance at the altar.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-58-007-014" data-verse-ref="KJV.58.007.014"><span class="verse-number">14</span>For it is evident that our Lord sprang out of Juda; of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-58-007-015" data-verse-ref="KJV.58.007.015"><span class="verse-number">15</span>And it is yet far more evident: for that after the similitude of Melchisedec there ariseth another priest,</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-58-007-016" data-verse-ref="KJV.58.007.016"><span class="verse-number">16</span>Who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-58-007-017" data-verse-ref="KJV.58.007.017"><span class="verse-number">17</span>For he testifieth, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-58-007-018" data-verse-ref="KJV.58.007.018"><span class="verse-number">18</span>For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-58-007-019" data-verse-ref="KJV.58.007.019"><span class="verse-number">19</span>For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope did; by the which we draw nigh unto God.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-58-007-020" data-verse-ref="KJV.58.007.020"><span class="verse-number">20</span>And inasmuch as not without an oath he was made priest:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-58-007-021" data-verse-ref="KJV.58.007.021"><span class="verse-number">21</span>(For those priests were made without an oath; but this with an oath by him that said unto him, The Lord sware and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec:)</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-58-007-022" data-verse-ref="KJV.58.007.022"><span class="verse-number">22</span>By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-58-007-023" data-verse-ref="KJV.58.007.023"><span class="verse-number">23</span>And they truly were many priests, because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-58-007-024" data-verse-ref="KJV.58.007.024"><span class="verse-number">24</span>But this man, because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-58-007-025" data-verse-ref="KJV.58.007.025"><span class="verse-number">25</span>Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-58-007-026" data-verse-ref="KJV.58.007.026"><span class="verse-number">26</span>For such an high priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-58-007-027" data-verse-ref="KJV.58.007.027"><span class="verse-number">27</span>Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people's: for this he did once, when he offered up himself.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-58-007-028" data-verse-ref="KJV.58.007.028"><span class="verse-number">28</span>For the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was since the law, maketh the Son, who is consecrated for evermore.</p>
