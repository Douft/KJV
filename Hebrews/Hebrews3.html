            <p class="verse" id="v-58-003-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.58.003.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses was faithful in all his house.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-58-003-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.58.003.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>For this man was counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who hath builded the house hath more honour than the house.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-58-003-004" data-verse-ref="KJV.58.003.004"><span class="verse-number">4</span>For every house is builded by some man; but he that built all things is God.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-58-003-005" data-verse-ref="KJV.58.003.005"><span class="verse-number">5</span>And Moses verily was faithful in all his house, as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after;</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-58-003-006" data-verse-ref="KJV.58.003.006"><span class="verse-number">6</span>But Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end.</p>

            <p class="verse" id="v-58-003-016" data-verse-ref="KJV.58.003.016"><span class="verse-number">16</span>For some, when they had heard, did provoke: howbeit not all that came out of Egypt by Moses.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-58-003-017" data-verse-ref="KJV.58.003.017"><span class="verse-number">17</span>But with whom was he grieved forty years? was it not with them that had sinned, whose carcases fell in the wilderness?</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-58-003-018" data-verse-ref="KJV.58.003.018"><span class="verse-number">18</span>And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that believed not?</p>
