            <p class="verse" id="v-58-008-001" data-verse-ref="KJV.58.008.001"><span class="verse-number">1</span>Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum: We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens;</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-58-008-002" data-verse-ref="KJV.58.008.002"><span class="verse-number">2</span>A minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-58-008-003" data-verse-ref="KJV.58.008.003"><span class="verse-number">3</span>For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices: wherefore it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-58-008-004" data-verse-ref="KJV.58.008.004"><span class="verse-number">4</span>For if he were on earth, he should not be a priest, seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-58-008-005" data-verse-ref="KJV.58.008.005"><span class="verse-number">5</span>Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See, saith he, that thou make all things according to the pattern shewed to thee in the mount.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-58-008-006" data-verse-ref="KJV.58.008.006"><span class="verse-number">6</span>But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established upon better promises.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-58-008-007" data-verse-ref="KJV.58.008.007"><span class="verse-number">7</span>For if that first covenant had been faultless, then should no place have been sought for the second.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-58-008-008" data-verse-ref="KJV.58.008.008"><span class="verse-number">8</span>For finding fault with them, he saith, Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-58-008-009" data-verse-ref="KJV.58.008.009"><span class="verse-number">9</span>Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they continued not in my covenant, and I regarded them not, saith the Lord.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-58-008-010" data-verse-ref="KJV.58.008.010"><span class="verse-number">10</span>For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people:</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-58-008-011" data-verse-ref="KJV.58.008.011"><span class="verse-number">11</span>And they shall not teach every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from the least to the greatest.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-58-008-012" data-verse-ref="KJV.58.008.012"><span class="verse-number">12</span>For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more.</p>
            <p class="verse" id="v-58-008-013" data-verse-ref="KJV.58.008.013"><span class="verse-number">13</span>In that he saith, A new covenant, he hath made the first old. Now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away.</p>
